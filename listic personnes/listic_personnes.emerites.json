        "abstract": "The feeling expressed by participants at UNITA meetings is that intercomprehension is effective in 2person discussions, but that larger groups prefer to communicate in English. A simple model can explain this observation. The choice of language depends on the number of participants, their command of the language and the complexity of the discussion. Context: Intercomprehension is the process that enables two people (or more) of different mother tongues to communicate, each in his or her native language. This process is promoted within UNITA, one of the 44 alliances participating in the European Universities initiative of the European Commission. The native language of the participants is not English. During a discussion, the alternative to intercomprehension is to switch to English, common language within scientific and academic communities., Le ressenti exprimé par les participants aux réunions UNITA est que l’intercompréhension est efficace lors des discussions à 2 personnes mais que les groupes préfèrent communiquer en anglais. Un modèle simple permet d’expliquer ce constat. Le choix de la langue dépend du nombre de participants, de leur maîtrise de la langue et de la complexité de la discussion.",

Hence, the sampling grid turns out to be parallelepipedic. In this paper, 3D anisotropic local distance operators are introduced. The problem of coefficient optimization is addressed for arbitrary mask size. Lower and upper bounds of scaling factors used for integer approximation are given. This allows, first, to derive analytically the maximal normalized error with respect to Euclidean distance, in any 3D anisotropic lattice, and second, to compute optimal chamfer coefficients.

Given an indexed tree structured library of bases and a semi-collaborative distribution scheme associated with minimum information exchange (emission and reception of one single index corresponding to a marginal best basis), the paper proposes the median basis computed on a set of best marginal bases for joint representation or fusion of distributed/dependent signals. The paper provides algorithms for computing this median basis with respect to standard tree structured libraries of bases such as wavelet packet bases or cosine trees. These algorithms are effective when an additive information cost is under consideration. Experimental results performed on distributed signal compression confirms worthwhile properties for the median of marginal best bases with respect to the ideal best joint basis, the latter being underdetermined in practice, except when a full collaboration scheme is under consideration.",

Therefore, we introduce a complete design procedure to learn and then optimize the system rule-base, called the Precise and Fast Fuzzy Modeling approach. Under this paradigm, fuzzy rules are generated from numerical data using a parameterizable greedy-based learning method called Selection-Reduction, whose accuracy-speed efficiency is confirmed through empirical results and comparisons with reference methods. Qualitative justification for this method is provided based on the co-action between fuzzy logic and the intrinsic properties of greedy algorithms. To complete the Precise and Fast Fuzzy Modeling strategy, we finally present a rule-base optimization technique driven by a novel rule redundancy index which takes into account the concepts of distance between rules and the influence of a rule over the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed index can be used to obtain compact rule-bases which remain very accurate, thus increasing system interpretability.",

To know the subsoil organization, Geophysicists try to interpret seismic images acquired by sending acoustic waves in the soil. This paper presents a method for the segmentation of these images in geological regions in order to help interpreters in their study. Information fusion of image attributes allows to solve part of this complex problem. To realize aggregation, the fuzzy subset theory is an appropriate tool to code interpreter knowledge by a set of rules. The results obtained are promising and show the necessity to evaluate their quality more thoroughly.",

        "abstract": "Last decades have seen huge amount of satellite data being made available by space agencies to the scientific community and to general public. As an example, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images products from European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 satellites are ready for use through the Copernicus program, which allows an new form of data sharing, diffusion and analysis. One application among many others is offset tracking of SAR images, which is widely used for measurement of large ground displacement as landslides, earthquakes or glacial flow. However, spatio-temporal measurement gaps exist because of surface changes of the observed targets from one acquisition to another. These measurements gaps hinder a full exploitation of the displacement measurement time series which provides useful information about the spatio-temporal evolution of the target under observation. On the other hand, there is a substantial lack of studies that are adapted to reconstruct missing data in displacement measurement time series with embedded error analysis. Therefore, we propose a data-adaptive interpolation method based on the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the temporal covariance of a displacement measurement time series to retrieve missing data. This EOF-based method decomposes temporal covariance in different EOF modes corresponding to different variations, from which coherent spatial patterns whose magnitudes vary over time can be obtained. The latter is used for data denoising and reconstruction by selecting a relevant number of EOF modes. In this method, data gaps are initialized by appropriate values and then modified after the EOF analysis of temporal covariance in an iterative process. The convergence criterion is based on the root mean square error between the reconstruction and the data for validation. The proposed method is first applied to a synthetic displacement time series containing missing data in order to 1) investigate some tuning parameters such as gap initialization value, noise characteristics, data gaps quantity and distribution, number of iteration, etc. and 2) to highlight the efficiency of the method. Then, the proposed method will be applied to a displacement measurement time series, issued from offset tracking of 65 Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired between October 2016 and December 2017 over the Argentière glacier. The results will be evaluated by InSAR measurement when they are available, otherwise by cross validation with offset tracking measurements.",

The proposed graphic user interface allows to obtain a better region detection compared with the detection obtained without fusion.

The processing of referees' preferences is achieved thanks to a recent method which consists in finding a generalized mean aggregation operator representing the preferences of a referee, in a finite ordinal scale context. The method allows to deal with consistency conditions on referees' behaviour in order to highlight the criteria or pair of criteria which are the most influential for each of the referees. All the functionalities have been implemented in an interactive decision software that facilitates a shared selection decision. Results issued from the 2007 selection are presented and analysed from the preference representation and processing point of view.",

Then, all pixels within the obtained adaptive neighborhood are, either complex averaged or estimated by the locally linear minimum mean squared error (LLMMSE), to yield a feature preserving reliable estimate of the polarimetric coherency matrix. The target entropy/alpha/anisotropy decomposition is applied on the derived polarimetric coherency matrix.

The way vibrotactile signals affect human perception is examined via three measured variables, related to their energy, velocity, and spectral complexity, and which are analytically defined in this paper. It is shown that these variables accurately account for the psychophysical properties of the tactile sense. Based on this, a psychophysical fuzzy rule-based model of vibrotactile perception is introduced to forecast the comfort values of the vibrational signals provided by an automobile haptic screen. Using an efficient rule-based generation method, a Mamdani fuzzy inference system is proposed; it achieves a mean error rate of 14% for the train set and 17% for the test set, while correctly classifying most of the signals within a reasonable tolerance, related to human evaluation imprecision. The system also produces a comprehensible linguistic rule structure, which allows behavioral patterns to be detected.",

Nevertheless, this projection involves an important alteration of the information of SAR images. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method by inverting the process: the radar rectification of georeferenced data. Coding data from a GIS into the radar geometry, allows the use of different information sources to improve the analysis of SAR images and the result interpretation.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a method for offshore oil slick detection. At present, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an image acquisition technology useful for oil slick detection in all weather conditions. It is used to carry out the detection, with notable limitations under certain conditions (surfaces, weather conditions). Manual SAR images analysis is expensive and, given the increasing amount of data collected from available sensors, automation becomes mandatory. To achieve this objective, instance object detection relying on deep neural networks is interesting to adapt to the data variability. Relying on such an approach, this article explores the capabilities of generalizing the detection of slicks on large datasets using the Mask-RCNN model. A detailed performance analysis is established in two complementary directions: (i) the impact of the SAR image characteristics(sensor, geographical areas, lookalike presence), (ii) the impact of the neural network architecture, transferred capabilities and training procedures. The main findings of this analysis show that Mask-RCNN features promising performance for pollution detection., Ce document présente une méthode de détection d'hydrocarbures sur la surface de mer. A présent, le radar à ouverture synthétique (SAR) est une technologie d'acquisition d'images utile pour la détection des nappes de pétrole dans toutes les conditions météorologiques. Il est utilisé pour effectuer la détection, avec des limitations notables dans certaines conditions (surfaces, conditions météorologiques). L'analyse manuelle des images SAR est coûteuse et, étant donné la quantité croissante de données collectées par les capteurs disponibles, l'automatisation devient obligatoire. Pour atteindre cet objectif, la détection d'objets par exemple en s'appuyant sur des réseaux neuronaux profonds est intéressante pour s'adapter à la variabilité des données. S'appuyant sur une telle approche, cet article explore les possibilités de généraliser la détection des nappes sur de grands ensembles de données en utilisant le modèle Mask-RCNN. Une analyse détaillée des performances est établie dans deux directions complémentaires : (i) l'impact des caractéristiques de l'image SAR (capteur, zones géographiques, présence de sosies), (ii) l'impact de l'architecture du réseau neuronal, des capacités transférées et des procédures de formation. Les principaux résultats de cette analyse montrent que le Mask-RCNN présente des performances prometteuses pour la détection de la pollution.",

        "abstract": "Driven by the growing complexity of real-world systems, current trends in fuzzy system modeling employ ways to automatically learn the system rule-base from numerical data. While these approaches greatly improve model accuracy, the resulting rule-base is generally less interpretable than expert-driven rule-bases. We provide qualitative justification for this behavior and show that automatic rule-base generation leads to the occurrence of redundant rules, i.e. rules encoding approximately the same knowledge. In order to improve interpretability, redundant rules must be properly detected and removed. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel measure to estimate the redundancy of fuzzy rules based on the common influence exerted by a pair of rules over the data, and weighted by some distance measure between rules. The concept of common influence, defined therein, indicates how two rules are linked by the data distribution. Our approach is validated on some analytical function modeling task and then tested on a real-world problem dealing with vibrotactile stimuli characterization. Both experiments showed that removing the most redundant rules, according to the proposed redundancy measure, yields smaller rule-bases of up to 25%, with only negligible drops in accuracy.",

This transition has however one important side effect, i.e the lack of feedback from the device, which in certain situations can be crucial. In order to overcome this, it has been suggested that feedback has to be delivered to the finger through vibrations that should be both detectable and comfortable. This paper aims to define a perception model for the sensory evaluations of the vibrotactile signals using fuzzy set theory. First of all, the hypothesis that haptic perception is strongly related to physical characteristics of the signals was evaluated and confirmed with a 93% correlation rate, based on psychophysical studies of the tactile sense. Secondly, using the previous analysis as a knowledge base we have implemented a fuzzy inference system which forecasts the preference values for vibrotactile signals. The preliminary results show that for 15 out of 18 signals, the preference is correctly predicted within a reasonable uncertainty interval.",

However, the understanding of such model decisions by humans is not straightforward and may limit their use for critical applications. In order to address this issue, recent research work has introduced explanation methods, typically for classification and captioning. Nevertheless, for some tasks, explainability methods need to be developed. This includes image segmentation that is an essential component for many high-level applications. In this paper, we propose a general workflow allowing for the adaptation of a state of the art explainability methods, especially SHAP, to image segmentation tasks. The approach allows for explanation of single pixels as well image areas. We show the relevance of the approach on a critical application such as oil slick pollution detection on the sea surface. We also show the applicability of the method on a more standard multimedia domain semantic segmentation task. The conducted experiments highlight the relevant features on which the models derive their local results and help identify general model behaviours.",

Nevertheless, this projection involves an important alteration of the information of SAR images. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method by inverting the process : the radar-rectification of georeferenced data. By coding data from a GIS into the radar geometry , we can use different information sources to improve the analysis of SAR images and the results interpretation.

        "abstract": "Ocean surface monitoring, emphasizing oil slick detection, has become essential due to its importance for oil exploration and ecosystem risk prevention. Automation is now mandatory since the manual annotation process of oil by photo-interpreters is time-consuming and cannot process the data collected continuously by the available spaceborne sensors. Studies on automatic detection methods mainly focus on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data exclusively to detect anthropogenic (spills) or natural (seeps) oil slicks, all using limited datasets. The main goal is to maximize the detection of oil slicks of both natures while being robust to other phenomena that generate false alarms, called “lookalikes”. To this end, this paper presents the automation of offshore oil slick detection on an extensive database of real and recent oil slick monitoring scenarios, including both types of slicks. It relies on slick annotations performed by expert photo-interpreters on Sentinel-1 SAR data over four years and three areas worldwide. In addition, contextual data such as wind estimates and infrastructure positions are included in the database as they are relevant data for oil detection. The contributions of this paper are: (i) A comparative study of deep learning approaches using SAR data. A semantic and instance segmentation analysis via FC-DenseNet and Mask R-CNN, respectively. (ii) A proposal for Fuse-FC-DenseNet, an extension of FC-DenseNet that fuses heterogeneous SAR and wind speed data for enhanced oil slick segmentation. (iii) An improved set of evaluation metrics dedicated to the task that considers contextual information. (iv) A visual explanation of deep learning predictions based on the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method adapted to semantic segmentation. The proposed approach yields a detection performance of up to 94% of good detection with a false alarm reduction ranging from 14% to 34% compared to mono-modal models. These results provide new solutions to improve the detection of natural and anthropogenic oil slicks by providing tools that allow photo-interpreters to work more efficiently on a wide range of marine surfaces to be monitored worldwide. Such a tool will accelerate the oil slick detection task to keep up with the continuous sensor acquisition. This upstream work will allow us to study its possible integration into an industrial production pipeline. In addition, a prediction explanation is proposed, which can be integrated as a step to identify the appropriate methodology for presenting the predictions to the experts and understanding the obtained predictions and their sensitivity to contextual information. Thus it helps them to optimize their way of working.",

The interactive fuzzy fusion is proposed to provide end-users with a simple and easily understandable tool for tuning the detection results.

        "abstract": "Ocean surface monitoring, especially oil slick detection, has become mandatory due to its importance for oil exploration and risk prevention on ecosystems. For years, the detection task has been performed manually by photo-interpreters using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with the help of contextual data such as wind. This tedious manual work cannot handle the increasing amount of data collected by the available sensors and thus requires automation. Literature reports conventional and semi-automated detection methods that generally focus either on oil slicks originating from anthropogenic (spills) or natural (seeps) sources on limited data collections. As an extension, this paper presents the automation of offshore oil slicks on an extensive database with both kinds of slicks. It builds upon the slick annotations of specialized photo-interpreters on Sentinel-1 SAR data for 4 years over 3 exploration and monitoring areas worldwide. All the considered SAR images and related annotation relate to real oil slick monitoring scenarios. Further, wind estimation is systematically computed to enrich the data collection. Paper contributions are the following : (i) a performance comparison of two deep learning approaches: semantic segmentation using FC-DenseNet and instance segmentation using Mask-RCNN. (ii) the introduction of meteorological information (wind speed) is deemed valuable for oil slick detection in the performance evaluation. The main results of this study show the effectiveness of slick detection by deep learning approaches, in particular FC-DenseNet, which captures more than 92% of oil instances in our test set. Furthermore, a strong correlation between model performances and contextual information such as slick size and wind speed is demonstrated in the performance evaluation. This work opens perspectives to design models that can fuse SAR and wind information to reduce the false alarm rate.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image orthorectification induces an important alteration of information due to the side-looking geometry of SAR acquisition. In high-relief areas, the difficulty is increased by the foldover effect: The images acquired with low incidence angles cannot be registered by a bijective transformation like polynomial transformations, as usually proposed by conventional software. In this letter, a simple and efficient method, fitted to geocoded data and SAR images, is introduced to propose a generic coregistration tool that takes SAR geometry into account without requiring the exact sensor model, specific parameters, and precise navigation data. This method is based on a simulated SAR image and on the computation of lookup tables (LUTs) that represent the coordinate transform from one geometry to the other. Results are presented on a high-relief area in the Alps, where satellite and airborne SAR images are used for glacier evolution monitoring. A comparison to other sensor-independent approaches has been performed, showing that the proposed approach performs better in mountain areas. The resulting LUTs allow merging SAR data with the georeferenced data, either in ground geometry by orthorectifying the SAR information or in radar geometry by the inverse transformation, namely, radar-coding data from a geographic information system, to improve the analysis of SAR images and the result interpretation.",

For economical and security reasons in the surrounding areas, the monitoring of those geophysical objects is being a necessity. SAR data are expected to provide dense measurements of physical parameters which are necessary to detect significant changes and to constrain glacier flow models. In this paper, five descending one-day ERS- 1/2 tandem interferometric data pairs from July 1995 to April 1996 are studied in the Chamonix Mont-Blanc area (French Alps). This multi-temporal interferogram series is used to analyse the coherence levels and fringe patterns over nine glaciers. Moreover, when the coherence is sufficient, Differential SAR Interferometry (D-InSAR) processing are applicable to derive a three-dimensional (3-D) velocity fields. An expert knowledge and a ten years measurements analysis of glacier flow are used to fix the line of sight (LOS) displacement offset. Finally, an analysis of the wrapped phase difference between interferograms is exposed to detect the presence of residual topographic fringes and to characterize the surface flow field evolution.",

        "abstract": "SAR interferometry (InSAR) performs two acquisitions (spatially separated by the baseline) of the signal back-scattered by the resolution cell which contains height and/or displacement information. Repeat pass spaceborne interferometry provides multi-interferograms which can be used to extract such information either by combining the multi-temporal results of conventional interferometry or by a different approach based on specific targets: the coherent stable scatterers (CSS). In this paper a two-step approach is proposed to obtain specific features from multi-temporal InSAR data sets. The first step consists in extracting image attributes related to the useful information. The second step consists in merging the attributes using an interactive fuzzy fusion technique. The interactive fuzzy fusion is proposed to provide end-users with a simple and easily understandable tool for tuning the detection results. The method is applied on a data set of five co-registered ERS 1/2 tandems from the French Alps (the Mont-Blanc region), including two temperate glaciers: the Argenti'ere and the Mer-de-glace. The results illustrate how the end-user can combine the proposed attributes to detect the presence of CSS or distributed stable scatterers usefull for multi-temporal analysis.",

Cet ouvrage présente un des aspects les plus importants du traitement des images : la \" segmentation \". Il récapitule d'abord les grandeurs observables et calculables sur une image et les algorithmes de manipulation des structures de données associées. Il détaille ensuite les traitements préliminaires, tels le filtrage du bruit et les deux types d'approche de la segmentation, l'extraction des contours et celle des régions. Chacune fait l'objet d'une étude théorique et de nombreux résultats illustrent les performances.

Remote sensing data provide useful information on such complex geophysical objects, but they require specific processing tech- niques to cope with the difficult context of moving and changing features in high-relief areas. This paper presents the first results of a project involving four laboratories developing and combining specific methods to extract information from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Two different information sources are processed, namely: 1) airborne photography and 2) spaceborne C-band SAR interferometry. The difficulties and limitations of their processing in the context of Alpine glaciers are discussed and illustrated on two glaciers located in the Mont-Blanc area. The results obtained by aerial triangulation techniques provide digital terrain models with an accuracy that is better than 30 cm, which is compatible with the computation of volume balance and useful for precise georeferencing and slope measurement updating. The results obtained by SAR differential interferometry using European Remote Sensing Satellite images show that it is possible to measure temperate glacier surface velocity fields from October to April in one-day interferograms with approximately 20-m ground sampling. This allows to derive ice surface strain rate fields required to model the glacier flow. These different measurements are complementary to results obtained during the summer from satellite optical data and ground measurements that are available only in few accessible points.",

The amplitude correlation technique applied on 11-day repeat pass data provides two projections of the surface displacement. The combined use of ascending and descending data acquired over almost the same period provides 4 different projections which can be geocoded and inverted to derive the 3D displacement field. Experimental results are presented on the Argentière glacier with stripmap HH images acquired over the Mont Blanc test site (Chamonix, France) during summer 2009. The results are compared with the available ground truth in the textured areas and on artificial targets (corner reflectors) installed on the glacier.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric data offer the opportunity to measure temperate glacier surface topography and displacement. The increase of the resolution provided by the most recent SAR systems has some critical implications. For instance, a reliable estimate of the phase gradient can only be achieved by using interferogram local frequencies. In this paper, an original two-step method for estimating local frequencies is proposed. The 2-D phase signal is considered to have two deterministic components corresponding to low-resolution (LR) fringes and high-resolution (HR) patterns due to the local microrelief, respectively. The first step of the proposed algorithm consists in the LR phase flattening. In the second step, the local HR frequencies are estimated from the phase 2-D autocorrelation function computed on adaptive neighborhoods. This neighborhood is the set of connected pixels belonging to the same HR spatial feature and respecting the \"local stationarity\" hypothesis. Results with both simulated TerraSAR-X interferograms and real airborne E-SAR images are presented to illustrate the potential of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "A new generation of space-borne SAR sensors were launched in 2006-2007 with ALOS, TerraSAR-X, COSMO-Sky-Med and RadarSat-2 satellites. The data available in different bands (L, C and X bands), with High Resolution (HR) or multi-polarization modes offer new possibilities to monitor glacier displacement and surface evolution by SAR remote sensing. In this paper, the first results obtained with TerraSAR-X HR SAR image time series acquired over the temperate glaciers of the Chamonix Mont-Blanc test site are presented. This area involves well-known temperate glaciers which have been monitored and instrumented i.e. stakes for annual displacement/ablation, GPS for surface displacement and cavitometer for basal displacement, for more than 50 years. The potential of 11-day repeated X-band HR SAR data for Alpine glacier monitoring is investigated by a combined use of in situ measurements and multi-temporal images. Interpretations of HR images, analysis of interferometric pairs and performance assessments of target/texture tracking methods for glacier motion estimation are presented. The results obtained with four time series covering the Chamonix Mont-Blanc glaciers over one year show that the phase information is rarely preserved after 11 days on such glaciers, whereas the high resolution intensity information allows the main glacier features to be observed and displacement fields on the textured areas to be derived.",

In order to address these problems, we suggest a formal framework using a dependent (higher order) type theory.

Two examples of meta-reasoning with transitivity and distributivity and a case study illustrate this approach.",

Alternatively, classical languages for conceptual modeling such as UML lack of formal foundations resulting in ambiguous interpretations of mereological relations. Moreover, they cannot prove that a given specification is correct from a logical perspective. In order to address all these problems, we suggest a formal framework using a dependent (higher-order) type theory such as those used in program checking and theorem provers (e.g., Coq). It is based on constructive logic and allows reasoning in different abstraction levels within the logic. Furthermore, it maximizes the expressiveness while preserving decidability of type checking and results in a coherent theory with a powerful sub-typing mechanism.",

Some approaches have developed formalizations that are both ontology-based and underpinned with Situation Theory. While the semantics of Situation Theory is very attractive from the cognitive point of view, the languages that are used to express knowledge and to reason with suffer from a number of limitations concerning both expressiveness and reasoning capabilities. In this paper we propose a more general formal foundation denoted S-DTT (Situation-based Dependent Type Theory) that is expressed with the language of the Extended Calculus of Constructions (ECC), a widely used theory in mathematical formalization and in software validation. Situation awareness relies on small blocks of knowledge called situation fragment types whose composition leads to a very expressive and unifying theory. The semantic part is provided by an ontology that is rooted in the S-DTT theory and, on which higher-order reasoning can be performed. The basis of the theory is summarized and its expressing power is illustrated with numerous examples. A scenario in the healthcare context for patient safety issues is detailed and a comparison with well-known approaches is discussed.",

However, most attempts to provide a formal model of contexts suffer from a number of difficulties, such as limited expressiveness of representation, restricted variable quantification, lack of (meta) reasoning about properties, etc. In addition, type theory originally developed for formal modeling of mathematics has also been successfully applied to the correct specification of programs and in the semantics of natural language. In this paper, we suggest a type theoretical approach to the problem of context and action modeling. Type theory is used both for representing the system's knowledge of the discourse domain and for reasoning about it. For that purpose, we extend an existing dependent type theory having nice properties, with context-based rules and appropriate inductive types. We claim that the resulting theory exploiting the power of dependent types is able to provide a very expressive system together with a unified theory allowing higher-order reasoning.",

        "abstract": "In the domain of ontology design as well as in Knowledge Representation, modeling universals is a challenging problem. Most approaches that have addressed this problem rely on Description Logics (DLs) but many difficulties remain, due to under-constrained representation which reduces the inferences that can be drawn and further causes problems in expressiveness. In mathematical logic and program checking, type theories have proved to be appealing but, so far they have not been applied in the formalization of ontologies. To bridge this gap, we present in this paper a theory for representing ontologies in a dependently-typed framework which relies on strong formal foundations including both a constructive logic and a functional type system. The language of this theory defines in a precise way what ontological primitives such as classes, relations, properties, etc., and thereof roles, are. The first part of the paper details how these primitives are defined and used within the theory. In a second part, we focus on the formalization of the role primitive. A review of significant role properties leads to the specification of a role profile and most of the remaining work details through numerous examples, how the proposed theory is able to fully satisfy this profile. It is demonstrated that dependent types can model several non-trivial aspects of roles including a formal solution for generalization hierarchies, identity criteria for roles and other contributions. A discussion is given on how the theory is able to cope with many of the constraints inherent in a good role representation.",

        "abstract": "During the last decade, the domain of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning, has known a renewal of interest for mereogeometry, a theory that has been initiated by Tarski. Mereogeometry relies on mereology, the Lesniewski's theory of parts and wholes that is further extended with geometrical primitives and appropriate definitions. However, most approaches (i) depart from the original Lesniewski's mereology which does not assume usual sets as a basis, (ii) restrict the logical power of mereology to a mere theory of part-whole relations and (iii) require the introduction of a connection relation. Moreover, the seminal paper of Tarki shows up unclear foundations and we argue that mereogeometry as it is introduced by Tarski, can be more suited to extend the whole theory of Lesniewski. For that purpose, we investigate a type-theoretical representation of space more closely related with the original ideas of Lesniewski and expressed with the Coq language. We show that (i) it can be given a more clear foundation, (ii) it can be based on three axioms instead of four and (iii) it can serve as a basis for spatial reasoning with full compliance with Lesniewski's systems.",

Most approaches which have addressed this problem rely either on Description Logics (DLs) or on First Order Logic (FOL), but many difficulties remain especially about expressiveness. In mathematical logic and program checking, type theories have proved to be appealing but so far, they have not been applied in the formalization of ontologies. To bridge this gap, we present here the main capabilities of a theory for representing ontological structures in a dependently-typed framework which relies both on a constructive logic and on a functional type system. The usability of the theory is demonstrated with the Coq language which defines in a precise way what ontological primitives such as classes, relations, properties and meta-properties, are in terms of type classes.",

        "abstract": "—The imprecision of natural language such as X is before Y does not provide any information about the distance between X and Y. The human's way of reasoning often uses incomplete knowledge, and any formalization of natural language should be able to produce qualitative reasoning. For that purpose, we introduce a modeling for specifying cognitive geometry. More precisely, in this paper we tackle the problem of geometric reasoning using a formal representation that is built from an appropriate spatial theory which departs from classical geometry in many points. Instead of basic spatial entities of ordinary geometry such as points, lines and surfaces, we rather consider physical three-dimensional objects used to perceive space based on pointless geometry. Based on Tarski's mereogeometry of solids, we explain how the interpretation of mereogeometry within Lesniewski's framework of mereology leads to a coherent and simplified framework in which qualitative representations (e.g., solids, balls, concentricity, equidistance, etc.) can be expressed. I. INTRODUCTION The qualitative representation of information assumes that knowledge about spatial information is expressed with a finite set of qualitative relations. It has a wide number of applications in the fields of computer vision [16], geographic information system [25], autonomous robot navigation [23], natural language understanding [3] and the like. When quantitative descriptions are not available or computationally intractable, qualitative representations appear as fruitful substitutes. For example, a few set of primitives forms the basis of a rich spatial calculus (see e.g., [17]). Assessing situations require to specify relationships between objects of the domain. Then, it seems natural to represent qualitative information with relations. Many approaches in qualitative representation are based on mereological theories. Mereology which is the theory of parts and wholes assumes that the part-of relation is the fundamental primitive [19]. However, mereology by itself is not a sufficient theory to take in account topological relations. For that purpose, mereotopology has been introduced as a common theory for integrating both topology and mereology [8], [24]. As underlined in [10] there are many situations in which mereotopology itself is lacking e.g., direction and orientation relations, distances and sizes or even, shapes. To cope with such deficiencies, mereogeometry which builds on the earlier work of Tarski [21], extends mereology with geometric",

Alternatively, classical languages for ontological reasoning such as Description Logics + Logic Programming lack of expressive formal foundations resulting in ambiguous interpretations of relations. Moreover, they show some difficulties to prove that a given meta property is logically correct. In order to address these problems, we suggest a formal framework using a dependent (higher-order) type theory such as those used in program checking and theorem provers (e.g., Coq). All properties of part-whole relations are formalized through abstract constructs called parameterized specifications (p-specifications). We detail their content and explain how they are suitable to build an ontology of formal properties that can be further used for reasoning about higher-order properties.",

In this paper we show that the introduction of a type theoretical formalism that relies both on a constructive logic and on a typed lambda calculus is able to go beyond these aspects in a single theory. In particular we will show that a number of logical choices (constructive logic, predicative universes for data types, impredicative1 universe for logic, ...) about the theory will lead to an highly expressive theory which allows for the production of conceptually clean and semantically unambiguous ontologies.",

For that purpose, the core problem is to have a powerful context model. While significative formalizations have been proposed, context models are either expressed through logical formalisms or with ontology-based approaches. The major problem with all that approaches is that they suffer from the chronic insufficiency of first-order logic to cope with dynamic change and especially, to solve the frame problem. Therefore, building context-aware software is a complex task due to a lack of appropriate formal models in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a model which combines the strengths of both approaches while trying not to carry their specific weaknesses into the resulting formal framework. For this purpose, the formal model relies both on a knowledge representation with ontologies and on a logical reasoning with Dependent Record Types (DRT) based on Intuitionistic Type Theory and the Curry-Howard isomorphism. This logic modelling aims to be applied to any kind of process-based applications.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the present paper is to provide a methodology where the functional characteristics of a distributed engineering system can be obtained by merging domaindependent knowledge at run-time. We focus on distributed control systems where computing nodes are related to the physical environment in which they operate via sensors/actuators. The knowledge representation is formally expressed with a mereological approach where a structural mereology describes the physical environment and a functional mereology identifies available engineering goals for each computing node. During the design step, a mechanism based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) allows to generate the resulting goal mereology. The concept of goal is refined with sub-concepts in the multilevel structure. Because computing nodes depend on each other for goals to be achieved, an agent-based method is proposed to establish dynamically the dependencies among distributed nodes. This method is centered on a fusion mechanism involving the functional mereologies of appropriate nodes. We use an example from an open-channel hydraulic system controlling the water level to motivate and illustrate the model. Although it is limited to the engineering systems, this approach can be reused in related domains where the goal representation can be expressed as a triple including an action, a role and a physical entity.",

Ludwik Finkelstein mainly contributed to this activity through several synthetic surveys and his formalisation of this theory includes a generalisation of the representation of measurement values to non-numerical sets. The role of group theory in the measurement theory was suggested by Stevens in his seminal paper. Such a role was explored by Narens and Luce for the ordered scales. The studied groups are homomorph to groups acting on real numbers, and other possible scales remain unexplored. For example, the metrical scales, introduced by Coombs, are built on distances and do not fit the classic classification of scale. Initially devoted to psychophysical measurement, metrical scales now appear in various fields, such as colour measurement or software measurement and need to be studied in more detail. The purpose of this paper is to revisit the group-based classification of scales and to show how such a classification includes metrical scales and more specifically fuzzy scales.",

After having recalled the smart sensor concepts, this paper introduces the symbolic sensor ones. Links between the physical world and the symbolic one are described. It is then shown how Zadeh's approximate reasoning theory provides a smart way to implement symbolic sensors.

A precise representation of fuzzy logic controllers by means of mappings is used to introduce different ways for dealing with fuzzy inputs. Two types of fuzzy inputs are presented and their potential use in fuzzy control is discussed. The proposed concepts are applied to control a first order process with a PI controller. This simple process is chosen to clearly illlustrate the behaviour of the closed-loop system using fuzzy inputs for fuzzy reference and fuzzy measurement. Finally, a nonlinear process is used to illustrate the effects of fuzzy inputs on a more complex system. Although it is sometimes speculated that fuzzy inputs may improve the behaviour of fuzzy controllers, experiments developed in this paper show this point is not straightforward and that the relevance of fuzzy inputs should be questionned in closed loop fuzzy control.",

The new idea developed in this study consists of handling a \" trend \" objective declaration, based on linguistic declarations of trends and Zadeh's precisiation concept, and then to analyse the impact of this on the performance expression. Indeed, knowing that an objective is declared by a target value and a temporal horizon, such a value can be more or less precise, declared in the form of a single final value or a trend value, throughout the temporal horizon. Moreover, the temporal horizon can be explicitly described by a numerical interval or only by its boundary. Given that the performance expression is defined as the achievement degree of the objective, such an expression can be enriched, in the case where the objective is declared by a trend value, by an expression that gives information about the trend of the objective achievement. Instantaneous and trend performances are thus jointed, leading in this sense to the handling of the temporal aspect that is inherent to the achievement of the objective and that suggests the trend performance expression. Throughout the study, the propositions are illustrated via a ratio rate objective.",

As the performance concept refers to the objective one, our idea is to relate the performance expression mechanism to that of the objective declaration. We propose a variable tree framework to describe the break-down of objectives and the expression of the performances, highlighting the multicriteria aspect of both the performance and the objectives. Moreover, the temporal aspects of the objective declarations are emphasised, leading to the introduction of both the objective and the performance temporal trajectories. Such trajectories take into account the whole of the temporal horizon that is associated with the achievement of the objective. The link between the provided trees and trajectories is established through the elementary objective notion which corresponds to the leaves of the trees. A conventional recursive depth-first search algorithm is applied to the variable tree for the computation of the corresponding performances, at any considered milestone of the temporal horizon. Finally, the overall throughput time of the hydraulic cylinders manufacturing line of the Bosch Rexroth Company is considered to illustrate the proposed ideas.",

From a concrete point of view, linguistic fuzzy systems are used to achieve a collaboration between numeric and expert processing. Three distinct architectures are proposed to combine conventional regulators and knowledge-based procedures in a unified control structure. All of them are based on a context-oriented decomposition of the control problem under consideration.

Performance expressions are the purpose of performance indicators and performance measurement systems - PMSs. We focus particularly on the elementary aspect of such an expression. The elementary performance expression is the constitutive element of the PMSs, being defined through the achievement degree of a considered objective, while other types of expressions are involved in PMSs, with regards to the multi-criteria and multilevel aspects of the objectives. The computation of the objective achievement brings together the objective declaration, the acquired measurement that reflects the reached state and the comparison of these parameters. By revisiting previous works handled in this field, we consider that elementary performance expression is modeled by a mathematical function that compares the objective to the measurement. Conventional Taylorian ratio and difference are highlighted. The qualitative or quantitative characteristic of the data, the flexibility concerning the objective declaration and the measurements errors lead us to use the fuzzy subset theory as a unified framework for expressing performance. It also leads to new approacheswhich are beyond comparison functions.",

Using colour in process control leads to specific problems where human perception has to be replaced by colour sensors. This paper relies on the fuzzy representation of colours that can be taken into account by fuzzy controllers. If smart sensors already include intelligent functionalities like signal processing, or configuration, only few of them include functionalities to elaborate the fuzzy representation of measurements. In this paper, we develop a solution where the numeric processing is performed locally by the sensor, and where fuzzy processing is exported towards another computing resource by means of the CAN network. This paper presents the concept and the application to a smart fuzzy spectrometer.",

Introduits pour doter les contrôleurs experts ou flous d'organes perceptifs adaptés, les capteurs flous sont actuellement conçus pour traiter des mesures à une seule composante. Afin de d'étendre leur domaine d'application aux mesures multicomposantes, nous proposons une technique originale d'agrégation de mesures basée sur la construction d'ensembles flous sur des espaces multidimensionnels. La perception de la couleur a été choisie pour mettre en oeuvre cette technique et pour tester les procédures de configuration qui lui sont associées. Abstract : This paper presents several results on symbolic sensors and fuzzy sensors dealing with multicomponent measurements. Fuzzy sensors were developped to cooperate with expert controlers or fuzzy controlers. Actually most of these sensors consider only a single measurement. In order to extend their domain to multicomponent measurements, we propose a new aggregation method. This method is based on fuzzy subsets in multidimensional spaces. Colour perception is chosen to apply this method and to test associated configuration functions.",

In order to manipulate information entities, relations that already exist on physical states are also converted into relations between information entities. Nominal scales are scales where the only relation being converted is an equivalence relation. In most applications of nominal scales, the symbolic representation of a physical state is a symbol. Another approach, named fuzzy description, shows that a physical state can be represented by a fuzzy subset of symbols. This paper presents how the fuzzy description can be interpreted into the scale formalism as a new kind of scale. It shows that a fuzzy nominal scale defines a proximity relation.",

Indeed, based on the ability of fuzzy systems to approximate any nonlinear mapping, the nonlinear system is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system, which is then inverted for designing the fuzzy controller. As an application of the proposed inverse control methodology, two popular control structures, namely feedback linearization and Nonlinear InternalModel Control (NIMC) structures, are investigated. Moreover, the paper points out that, under some conditions, both control structures are equivalent and naturally implement a Smith predictor in presence of time delays.",

Les performances sont exprimées à des instants fixés, notamment l'instant final de l'horizon temporel associé à l'objectif. Nous proposons d'enrichir cette manière de prendre en compte le temps dans la performance en associant à sa forme instantanée, deux formes supplémentaires, la forme tendancielle et la forme prédictive. La performance instantanée exprime le résultat de la comparaison de l'objectif avec sa mesure à un instant de l'horizon temporel. La performance prédictive véhicule, à un instant, l'expression de la performance qui serait atteinte à un instant futur de l'horizon. La performance tendancielle donne une indication, sur un intervalle de l'horizon, sur l'évolution de la mesure au regard de l'évolution de l'objectif. A l'issue d'un rappel de ce qu'est la performance instantanée, une définition formelle est proposée pour les performances prédictive et tendancielle, ainsi qu'une réflexion sur l'utilisation de ces performances. Cherchant à proposer des expressions quantitatives, qualitatives et agrégées de ces performances, nous aurons recours à une formalisation floue, conformément à des développements menés précédemment. Enfin, des exemples, extraits de l'étude en cours d'un cas industriel, illustrent nos propos. Abstract-This study deals with the temporal performance. The performance notion can be seen as being related to the achievement of objectives. Industrial practice focuses nowadays on an instantaneous performance form, leading thus to the expression of performances at different milestones of the objective temporal horizon, notably the final instant. We look here to enrich the temporal instantaneous form of the performance by two additive temporal forms, the predictive form and the trend form. Instantaneous performance handles the comparison of the objective with the acquired measure, at a given instant of the considered horizon. The predictive performance gives, at an instant, the performance that would be reached at a future instant of the horizon. The trend performance gives an indication about the evolution of the measure with regards to the evolution of the objective, throughout an interval of the horizon. After a review of the instantaneous performance definition, we propose formal definitions of both predictive and trend performances, as well as a means for using these performances. According to previous works, fuzzy formalism is a support for the framework, for the handling of qualitative, quantitative and aggregated expressions. Examples that are extracted from an industrial study in progress, illustrate these ideas.",

Furthermore, this vision allows an extension of the interval arithmetic arsenal and reasoning to the framework of T2FIs. The proposed approach can be regarded as more computationally viable, which will make T2FIs computations more useful in applied scenarios. As an illustration, the proposed concept is used to implement the elementary arithmetic operations on T2FIs. The potentialities of the TGI approach have been validated in the frameworks of T2FI aggregation operators and T2FI regression.",

In this paper, we combine the concepts of gradual numbers and Kaucher arithmetic on extended intervals to define extended gradual interval arithmetic, where subtraction and division operators are, respectively, the inverse operators of the addition and the multiplication. They are applied to the inversion of a linear regressive model and to a control problem that is based on the inversion of a linear model.",

Unifié et fondé sur un formalisme flou, le modèle proposé distingue trois sortes de performances temporelles, respectivement la performance instantanée, la performance tendancielle et la performance prédictive. Conformément aux préceptes du management visuel, des expressions symboliques ont été définies pour chaque type de performance. En outre, des méthodes d’agrégation, à base de règles, de ces performances ont été développées, afin de fournir des informations synthétiques, faciles à interpréter. L’application retenue ici relève de l’amélioration du Taux de Rendement Synthétique (TRS), chez le cuisiniste Fournier. Par le biais de la recherche de la réduction des temps d’arrêt en production, les réflexions menées nous permettront de conclure sur la pertinence de considérer le triplet des performances temporelles proposées ainsi que sur les développements à considérer ultérieurement. The aim of this study is to consider how the fuzzy temporal performance framework that we have previously developed can deal with industrial practice. Previous works have focused on formal handling of what we called \"temporal performance\", which is made of an instantaneous performance, a trend performance and a predictive performance respectively. According to visual management principle, symbolic expressions have been associated to such performances. Fuzzy rule-based aggregations have been introduced, leading thus to aggregate the temporal performances and to provide synthetic pieces of information for the decision-making. The considered case study deals with the improvement of the OEE (Overall Equipment Efficiency) of the Société Fournier company. The submitted problem concerns the workshop performance improvement with regards to the production lines and the associated stopping time. Some concluding remarks will allow us to analyse, on the one hand, the relevance of the proposed model and the extensions, on the other hand, to bring to it.",

First, Mamdani-type conventional fuzzy logic controllers are presented, including when rulebases are chained. Then, from the modal equivalence principle, advanced Takagi'Sugeno fuzzy controllers are introduced especially those relying on input'output linearization techniques. Examples, all available in FlouLib demos, are used to show the potentialities of FlouLib for control engineering curricula.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with conceptual considerations regarding the objective notion as well as the performance expression that is associated with its achievement. The suggested idea is to consider that the way the performance expression is computed depends on what we call the semantics of the objective. By considering that objectives are declared under the form of expected states, by anyone at any moment and with regards to any system, two specific kinds of such objectives will be thus distinguished; the “desire”-objective on the one hand and the “requirement”-objective on the other hand. Besides, by considering that performance expression identifies the achievement degree of the assigned objective, we will show that this expression will also adopt different semantics. So-called “performance evaluation” and “performance measurement” will thus be distinguished in this context. In order to do this, we will first begin by recalling the essential definitions related to the objective notion, then the ones concerning the performance expression. We will thus show how the fuzzy subsets theory can be used in order to formalise both the desire-objective declaration and the requirement-objective declaration, as well as to compute their respective performance expression. Some industrial illustrations, which are extracted from a hydraulic cylinder manufacturer, will be presented simultaneously with the fuzzy formalisation. At the end of this study, concluding remarks and prospects will be then addressed.",

This transformation requires the knowledge of the dependency relationship between the two added variables. In fact, the comonotone case is closely related to the Zadeh's extension principle. It often leads to the worst case in terms of specificity of the corresponding possibility distribution, but it may arise that the independent case is worse than the comonotone case, e.g. for symmetric Pareto probability distributions. When no knowledge about the dependence is available, a least specific pos-sibility distribution can be obtained from Fréchet bounds.",

Des exemples de distributions de probabilité bivariées à support fini sont présentés.",

They concern: the definition of a possibility distribution equivalent to a probability one from its whole set of dispersion intervals for all the probability levels, the bridges with the conventional dispersion parameters, the representation of a partial probability knowledge thanks to a maximum specificity principle better than the maximum entropy principle and also related to probability inequalities. The use of a possibility representation for common measurement situations such as the description of measurement results, measurand estimation and the expression of a priori uncertainty information are illustrated, and then discussed in view of their use in further processing (propagation, fuzzy inference systems). The conclusion highlights the interests of the possibility approach and points out some remaining issues.",

Cette transformation nécessite la connaissance de la relation de dépendance entre les deux variables aléatoires à ajouter. Nous considérons les cas de deux variables aléatoires continues symétriques toutes deux indépendantes ou comonotones. En fait, le cas comonotone est intiment lié au principe d'extension de Zadeh, et constitue souvent le pire cas en terme de spécificité, c'est-à-dire donnant les intervalles de dispersion les plus larges, néanmoins il peut arriver que l'indépendance soit pire que la comonotonie comme par exemple pour des lois de Pareto symétriques. Quand aucune information sur la dépendance n'est disponible, des bornes issues des bornes de Fréchet peuvent être utilisées pour construire la distribution de possibilité la moins spécifique.",

This practice acknowledged by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Guide is a major shift from the probabilistic representation. It can be viewed as a probability/possibility transformation by viewing possibility distributions as encoding coverage intervals. In this paper, we extend previous works on unimodal distributions by proposing a possibility representation of bimodal probability distributions. Indeed, U-shaped distributions or Gaussian mixture distribution are not very rare in the context of physical measurements. Some elements to further propagate such bimodal possibility distributions are also exposed. The proposed method is applied to the case of three independent or positively correlated C-grade resistors in series and compared with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and Monte Carlo methods.",

        "abstract": "The great number of e-business websites existing over internet make the customers undecided on which one is the more appropriate for their purchase. Thus recommendation websites have appeared. They propose an aggregation of the customer's evaluations critics on the e-business websites according to several criteria such as prices and conditions offers, after sales service and payment security, etc. In fact a partial score relative to an evaluation criterion is associated to each critic. It's either a precise numerical value or a purely qualitative value. Then, an average upon the global scores of the customers is used to evaluate the average e-business global score. This drastic reduction to average scores prevents the users from really appreciating the uncertainty in an e business website evaluation. Indeed, it does not give any idea about the variability or controversial dimension of the customers' opinions. All these aspects gathered bias the final decision. One way to overcome this problem is to consider a possibility theory based uncertainty representation and to construct possibility distributions from the customer's evaluations according to each criterion. Possibility distribution representations of the customer's evaluation allow thus to take into account the whole information in the decision making process. We address the issue of how to interpret the aggregated uncertainty representation in the global evaluation. Indeed, the uncertainty analysis of the system was conducted for the purpose of aiding in a decision. Thus, concise easily interpretable pieces of information, such as variability or controversial aspect of the customer's opinions, are useful. In this view, we propose to describe possibility distributions by indicators of location, ignorance, divergence, and to determine the contribution of each partial indicators to the global indicators.",

Therefore, in this paper, we propose elucidation functionalities of the aggregated results as well as a definition of risk expressions of one movie recommendation based on a multi-criteria aggregation with the Choquet integral. Finally, a first approach is proposed to control the recommendation risk by adding in the database new reviews about the movies placed nearly equal.",

The FBDS database is composed of customers' satisfaction measures. These measures are related to the different services an EC offers to its customers. Thus, they constitute a multi criteria (MC) evaluation of EC performances. In the general framework of recommender systems, these available MC evaluations are considered as useful information for other customers to help them to objectively, rationally and exhaustively assess and compare the numerous ECs among the ones likely to meet their needs. Our FBDS is not concerned with improving or automating such a recommendation process for customers. Indeed, it is merely EC management team oriented. In fact, the MC feedback database is used to diagnose the EC health and improve its strategy. In the proposed FBDS, a possibilistic framework is combined with the multi criteria representation to capture the variability and the divergence of customers' evaluations w.r.t. each criterion. Then, an aggregation based on a weighted arithmetic mean (WAM) is proposed to obtain a synthetic appraisal of ECs. The WAM aggregation models the strategy agreed on by the EC management team. Computing the synthesis score of an EC consists in propagating the uncertainty related to its partial scores through the WAM. The possibilistic representation guarantees that no information is lost in the collective evaluation process by the consumers' community. However, diagnosis indicators are finally proposed to the marketing team to make the interpretation of some possibilistic results more comprehensive when necessary.",

Since XAI is human-centred, it has strong connections with fuzzy systems. In this paper, we consider the local explanation of the output of a set of fuzzy linguistic rules from the contributions of the inputs to the output. The proposed contributions are defined from the average of the gradients on the line linking the start point to the end point. This approach ensures that the variation in the output is equal to the sum of the contributions of each input variable to the output. The considered application is based on avalanche expert knowledge expressed by a set of fuzzy rules that combines different physical variables to build an ordinal fuzzy scale of avalanche vigilance (\"Relaxed\", \"Suspicious\", \"Alert\", \"Gamble\"). The level of vigilance to be applied locally, along a mountain ski route, is explained in a way that is close to expert reasoning in order to decide modifications of the route.",

Legitimating this choice by only a strategic financial point of view currently has some limits, because additional ones such as quality, delay, resources needs have also to be taken into account. The MCDA approaches have been developed to deal with problems such as ranking, sorting or quantification. The purpose of this paper is to describe the operational aspects in MCDA deployment through a case study submitted by the SME Fournier Company. This paper concerns analytical overall performance models to allow the DMs to select potential actions to launch regarding given decision criteria. The principles of the main MCDA approaches are presented. Then representative MCDA methods, ELECTRE III and MACBETH, are successively deployed to a tactical decision problem of business turn-over increase. From the building of their respective preference modelling, decision aid is provided in the form of preference relation or performance function. A formal framework supplying information to the industrial DMs in order to legitimate the action selection is described. In addition the DMs feedback highlights the required expertise for the preference modelling. The article gives a guideline for industrial practitioners to carry out ELECTRE III and MACBETH for their improvement action selection. SMEs can find an adapted framework for their improvement actions choice dealing with financial and non-financial criteria. It is also enriched by practical considerations concerning the methods deployment for tactical decision problems.",

Performance Measurement Systems (PMSs) have been developed to support decision-making for reaching the objectives and launching adequate action plans. PMSs provide thus performance expressions which identify objective satisfaction degrees. Two kinds of performance expressions are useful in industrial problems, according to the scale (unipolar, bipolar) that is used for their definition. Moreover, these expressions generally have to be synthesized for global control purposes, determining an overall performance raises the issue of performance aggregation. To address such an aggregation issue, adequate multi-criteria methods need to be implemented. Most of the approaches proposed in the literature either do not provide explicit mechanisms, or rely on too simple methods. This paper deals with the definition of a performance combination based on mathematical tools, especially the generalized Choquet integral to take into account on the one hand criteria interactions and on the other hand both unipolar and bipolar scales. An application to a PMS for the service rate of a SME producing kitchen elements is used to illustrate the approach.",

Lastly, a determination of the contributions of each criterion assessment uncertainty to the overall assessment uncertainty provides useful information to the head manager in controlling the decision deliberation by reducing the inconsistent points in the experts' assessments.

Indeed, industrial performances are now defined in terms of numerous criteria to be synthesized for overall improvement purposes. The analysis of the literature leads to the conclusion that most of the proposed approaches deal with a qualitative approach of this multi-criteria issue. But only a few quantitative models for PMSs have been proposed in order to better monitor the continuous improvement cycle. Among them, the one proposed by the authors, based on a Choquet integral aggregation operator, allows to express an overall performance according to subordination and transverse interactions between the criteria involved. But, as this model is non linear, it is useful to define pieces of information aimed at aiding the manager to improve the performance situation. Thus, this article is a contribution to the managers' requirements for optimizing the improvement of the overall performance versus the allocated resources. In this view, indexes of efficiency and predictive improvement are proposed. The approach is applied to a case study submitted by a company manufacturing kitchen and bathroom furniture which wants to upgrade the monitoring of its “environment and quality improvement plan”.",

Industrial decision-makers require, thus, pieces of information about the satisfaction of the fixed objectives on the one hand and the potential actions to launch on the other hand. In this sense, they carry out more or less formal decision mechanism using their knowledge. In this study some reflexions concerning the relevance of the use of the MDCA methods for the selection of the action plans with regard to the performances are proposed. More precisely, the widely used ELECTRE and MACBETH methods are considered. These approaches are analysed, as they deal with human knowledge, in the particular case of an industrial improvement process, handled by the Fournier Company.

It could appear as a genuine benefit but this world also is one of endless choice: how can we select from a huge universe of items of widely varying quality? How can we take into account many evaluation criteria to soundly evaluate all these potentials choices? We need expert advices. Recommender Systems (RS) have emerged to address this issue: they're based on the customers' critics and their authentic experiences upon the competing items. The purpose of RS is thus providing recommendations from people who are familiar with the choices we face: they can be considered as experts from this point of view. The example we deal with in this paper is the choice of an e-business site (e-retailer) when making purchases on the web. On the basis of the gathered expert critics, this paper explains how to design multi criteria evaluation aids and traceability functions for legitimate choices and logical argumentation. The evaluation of each competing e-retailer results from a multi criteria assessment by the collected experts' critics. A Choquet integral based aggregation is used to consider interactions between criteria in the overall user rating. The argumentation principle underlying this approach is based naturally on coupling the base of expert critics in natural language and an information fusion system. The reliability of the ranking introduces the notion of decisional risk. All these proposals are extended in the case of imprecise or uncertain evaluations by experts.",

In this order, multicriteria objectives are defined coherently with the company's strategy and performance improvements are launched continuously to reach these objectives. The steps of improvement approaches generally implemented use the traditional feedback loop principle, in accordance with the Deming wheel (Plan-Do-Check-Act). In this context, the definition of performance indicators which give pieces of information about the objectives reaching degree during the all the improvement approach duration is a key point . Moreover in order to globally control the improvement approach, it is useful for the decision-makers DMs to get an overall expression synthesizing the elementary ones, for instance to choose or rank the potential improvement actions. So MCDA methods have been considered which define preference model in order to express coherently the different performance expressions. The proposed framework is based on the MACBETH methodology which allows the definition of consistent performance expressions according to interval scales. It has been adapted at the 2-additive Choquet Integral to take the criteria interaction into account. It will be applied at several companies involved in different improvement approaches (Quality and Environmental Plan, Lean Manufacturing, Sustainable development, Supply Chain Management). In complement, the ELECTRE method has also be considered to make an improvement action hierarchy in a Business turn-over increase approach",

        "abstract": "The authors are developing multi criteria Decision-Making Support Systems (DMSS) for project teams in charge of selecting a technical solution among alternatives. They propose a cybernetic framework to emphasize the link between decision-making and knowledge management processes in such projects. These DMSS's rely on the tracking of the accompanying knowledge production of long-term decisional processes by a collective with many actors. Based on knowledge production management, this paper explains how to design decisional risk evaluation, monitoring and control aids and traceability functions for strategic choices and logical argumentation. The DMSS is seen as a recommender system for the project manager. Each possible solution involved in the decision-making process is evaluated by means of a set of criteria. The evaluation results from an interpretation of the knowledge items in terms of satisfaction scores of the solutions according to the considered criteria. Aggregating these partial scores provides a ranking of all the possible solutions by order of preference. As criteria are sometimes interacting, the aggregation has to be based on adapted operators, i.e. Choquet integrals. Evaluating possible solutions by the knowledge contained in the knowledge base opens the way to automating the argumentation of the project team's decisions: the argumentation principle underlying this approach is based naturally on coupling a knowledge dynamical management system (KDMS) with the DMSS. The DMSS also evaluates the decisional risk that reflects the eventuality of a wrong selection due to the insufficiency of available knowledge at a given time in order to adopt a reliable solution. Decisional risk assessment corresponds to sensitivity analyses. These analyses are then exploited to control the decisional risk in time: they enable to identify the crucial information points for which additional and deeper investigations would be of great interest to improve the stability of the selection in the future. The knowledge management of a collective project is represented as a control loop: the KDMS is the actuator, the risk accompanying the decision is the controlled variable and is strongly linked to the entropy of the knowledge base managed by the KDMS. Each of the three phases—Intelligence, Design, Choice—of the decision-making process is identified to a function of the control loop: actuator, process and regulator. This cybernetic framework for decision has its origin in knowledge management activities for a great-scale project—the EtLD project of the French Atomic Commission (CEA) that concerns the management of high-level long-life radioactive waste in France.",

        "abstract": "Marketing is an area that aims at satisfying the desires and needs of consumers or groups of consumers (segments marketing), and guaranteeing commercialization of goods and services proposed in optimal conditions of profit. Marketing is thus a set of methods and means at the organization's disposal to promote behaviors, in its target audiences, in favor of the achievement of its own objectives. Marketing therefore aims at forecasting, detecting, causing, altering or stimulating consumers' needs and continuously adapting the production facilities and the commercial structures to the diagnosed needs. We focus our study on marketing activities in e-commerce because the marketing unit of e-commerce has a particularly large source of information at its disposal: hundreds of e-consumers criticisms and evaluations that are continuously gathered and updated through the web facilities. From these criticisms, relevant tendency indicators for marketing analysis could be computed. Indeed, nowadays thousands of people are turning to computational Recommender Systems (RS) before making an e-purchase. RS aim to mediate, support, or automate the everyday process of sharing recommendations between cyberconsumers' communities. They allow them to criticize and evaluate e-retailers according to different criteria such as Range of Services/Products, Product & Service Pricing, Purchase Tracking, Delivery Time, Security of Payment... These so partitioned evaluations databases constitute a gold mine for the marketing unit of an e-commerce. The marketing activity can thus be modelled as a multi criteria analysis of these databases. Furthermore, this analysis must be performed within an uncertain framework due to the dispersion of the opinions of the e-customers. We address these issues with non linear multi criteria aggregation techniques based on the Choquet integral to take interactions between criteria into account and possibility distributions to represent the opinions' dispersion. The global evaluation of an e-commerce is thus perceived as a fuzzy number that results from the aggregation of the partial distributions associated to the evaluation criteria. The marginal contribution of a criterion to the global evaluation of an e-retailer is a basic and useful notion to marketing activities. Indeed, the marketing unit of an e commerce can thus estimate the impact or influence of each dimension of the activity of the e commerce in real time, determine the criteria on which the e-commerce activity should be improved first in order to improve its overall rating as much as possible. Moreover, this principle can be extended to the relative comparison with other competing eretailers. The case of multi modal distributions of e-consumers' evaluations is finally tackled. This principle can easily be transposed in any manufacturing facility to elaborate diagnosis and improvement indexes for a multi-criteria industrial performance synthesized by a Choquet integral aggregation.",

Therefore, we introduce a complete design procedure to learn and then optimize the system rule-base, called the Precise and Fast Fuzzy Modeling approach. Under this paradigm, fuzzy rules are generated from numerical data using a parameterizable greedy-based learning method called Selection-Reduction, whose accuracy-speed efficiency is confirmed through empirical results and comparisons with reference methods. Qualitative justification for this method is provided based on the co-action between fuzzy logic and the intrinsic properties of greedy algorithms. To complete the Precise and Fast Fuzzy Modeling strategy, we finally present a rule-base optimization technique driven by a novel rule redundancy index which takes into account the concepts of distance between rules and the influence of a rule over the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed index can be used to obtain compact rule-bases which remain very accurate, thus increasing system interpretability.",

Trois mesures de dissemblance sont utilisées dans cette application afin de garantir une conclusion plus générale quant aux performances des transformations probabilité-possibilité., In the literature, there exist different consistency criteria that were enounced and which are used to validate somehow the choice of one of those probability-possibility transformations among the others. However the effectiveness of those transformations in a real case is not known. Thus, this paper aims to present a framework to compare their performances for modeling precisely real data through an application of change detection. In this application, the information contained in the image is represented thanks to a possibility distribution obtained from one of the most studied transformations and applied to basic probability assignement. The possibility distributions are compared with dissimilarity measures and the rate of good classification is computed through a \\emph{Receiving Operator Curve} (ROC). Different dissimilarity measures are used in order to be able to assess the performance of the five probability-possibility transformations.",

        "abstract": "An emerging way to reduce the geodetic parameter uncertainty is to combine the large numbers of data provided by satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, the measurements by radar imagery are subject to both random and systematic uncertainties. Thus, mathematical theories that are adequate for each type of uncertainty representation and handling have to be selected. Probability theory is known as the adequate theory for uncertainties corresponding to random variables, but questionable for systematic uncertainties, arising from information incompleteness. Fuzzy theory, being a generalization of interval mathematics, is more adapted to such uncertainty. Moreover, it provides a bridge with probability theory by its ability to represent a family of probability distributions. Therefore, we consider here the conventional probability and the fuzzy approaches for handling the random and systematic uncertainties of displacement measurements derived from differential SAR interferometry (D-InSAR) and SAR amplitude image correlation. The applications are performed on the measurement of the displacement field due to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. The fuzzy approach, being free from distribution and independence hypotheses, gives the most pessimistic uncertainty assessment, while the conventional probability approach gives the most optimistic uncertainty assessment. As confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulation applied to an earth deformation model, the actual uncertainty should be situated between the fuzzy and conventional uncertainties.",

In fact, this approach defines the upper bound of the probability distributions consistent with these confidence intervals. Applying the proposed transformation to a uniform probability distribution, the result is a triangular possibility distribution. Moreover, it is shown that this triangular possibility distribution is an upper bound of any possibility distribution equivalent (in the above sense) to a probability distribution bounded by the support of the triangle. Bridges with the weil-known probability inequalities of Bienaymé-Chebychev and Camp-Meidel are also established. Keywords : uncertainty, possibility theory, probability theory.",

To know the subsoil organization, Geophysicists try to interpret seismic images acquired by sending acoustic waves in the soil. This paper presents a method for the segmentation of these images in geological regions in order to help interpreters in their study. Information fusion of image attributes allows to solve part of this complex problem. To realize aggregation, the fuzzy subset theory is an appropriate tool to code interpreter knowledge by a set of rules. The results obtained are promising and show the necessity to evaluate their quality more thoroughly.",

The design and use of Performance Measurement Systems (PMSs) in this sense have received considerable attention in recent years, but only a few quantitative models for PMSs have been proposed for this purpose. Among them, the one proposed by the authors, based on a fuzzy Choquet integral aggregation operator, that allows to express an overall performance according to the relative importance of criteria and interactions between them. As this model is non linear, it is useful to define pieces of information aimed at aiding the decision-maker to optimize the improvement of the overall performance with regards to the allocated resources and the associated costs. Moreover, the consequences of the non complete realization of the optimal improvement strategy have also to be quantified in terms of overall performance decrease or cost increase. The propositions are illustrated on a case study submitted by a SME manufacturing kitchens, bathrooms and storing closets",

The possibility distributions are obtained thanks to a previously proposed probability-possibility transformation lying on the principle that a possibility measure can encode a family of probability measures. We consider here two particular possibility distributions build from parameter estimation of the Weibull and Rayleigh probability laws. The analytical expression of the KL divergence for the two considered possibility distributions are given, allowing a simple computation which depends on the parameters of the possibility distribution obtained. This new similarity measure is compared to the existing KL divergence for probability distributions in a context of change detection over simulated images as they provide a ground-truth of the changes required to evaluate the rate of true detection against false alarm.",

The original contribution of this work lies in the means proposed to the end-user for tuning the fuzzy membership functions in a two-dimensional universe for particular 2D reference image sections. The proposed graphic user interface allows to obtain a better region detection compared with the detection obtained without fusion. Moreover, a conﬁdence index, based on information theory concepts, is introduced. This index is based on a coeﬃcient of attribute inﬂuence and provides some elucidation on how the fusion results have been obtained.",

Based on the KDMS, this paper explains how to design collective evaluation aids and traceability functions for strategic decisions and logical argumentation.

We focus more particularly in this study on the DM's requirements to choose for each improvement iteration, the priority elementary performance to have a significant improvement of the overall performance. Our approach is based on a Performance Measurement System model, with regard to an overall objective and its sub objectives. Given the elementary performances that are associated to the involved sub objectives, the model provides an overall performance by using the 2-additive aggregation operator of the Choquet integral (CI) family, which generalises common aggregation operators. This article considers the temporal sub-objectives determination, the so-called intermediary elementary expressions, through their impact on the overall performance improvement. Three indexes - overall, local and average - are introduced in order to quantify this impact. The propositions are applied to the business turn-over performance improvement of a SME company.",

Comment ne pas citer l’exemple du dictionnaire multilingue de la machine outil de E. Wüster, fondateur de la terminologie moderne, où le dessin technique exprimé dans un langage figuratif et normalisé constitue une représentation non verbale du concept reléguant les définitions en langue naturelle au rang d’explications linguistiques. Parmi les représentations non verbales des concepts, les représentations formelles tiennent aujourd’hui une place prépondérante en terminologie. Dans le cadre de cette contribution nous verrons que de telles représentations, en particulier avec l’apport des ontologies issues de l’ingénierie des connaissances, permettent non seulement l’opérationnalisation des terminologies à des fins de traitement de l’information, mais qu’elles impactent également le travail terminologique dans ses principes et ses fondements. Ce tournant ontologique de la terminologie amène à distinguer les définitions formelles des concepts, spécifications logiques et objectives, des définitions en langue naturelle. Il permet de normaliser ce qui peut l’être, à savoir les connaissances du domaine, et de préserver ce qui doit l’être, à savoir la diversité langagière. La langue, même scientifique et technique, ne se laisse pas normaliser.",

        "abstract": "En définissant le terme comme une « désignation verbale d’un concept », et le concept comme « une unité de connaissance », la Terminologie dite « classique » ou « conceptuelle » met l’accent sur la double dimension de la Terminologie, linguistique (désignation verbale) et conceptuelle (unité de connaissance). Elle insiste également sur le rôle premier tenu par le concept : il n’y a pas de terme sans concept, la réciproque n’étant pas nécessairement vraie. On s’intéressera donc ici, non pas au sens du terme qui se construit en discours (ce qui inclut le sens référentiel), mais à ce que le terme dénote en dehors de tout discours. La « définition du terme » est alors une définition dite de « chose », c’est-à-dire une explication de ce que sont les choses dénotées par le terme. En explicitant le concept, c’est-à-dire en le définissant dans un langage formel, la « définition du terme » apparaît alors comme une « traduction » en langue naturelle de la « définition logique du concept ». Se posent alors deux questions principales. La première concerne ce que l’on entend par « définition logique » d’un concept, et dans quel langage elle s’écrit. La seconde porte sur le processus de « traduction » en langue naturelle d’une définition formelle, sa faisabilité et son automatisation. Ces deux questions fondamentales dépendent directement du langage formel utilisé et de la théorie du concept sur laquelle repose ce langage. Cet article est structuré en trois parties. Dans un premier temps nous rappelons ce que nous entendons par Terminologie considérée comme discipline comme le préconisent la Théorie Générale de la Terminologie (Felber 1984) et les normes ISO en Terminologie (ISO 1087) (ISO 704). Nous étudions ensuite la notion de «concept» : comment la définir, quelles sont les principales théories du concept, et enfin quels sont les langages formels permettant de définir des systèmes conceptuels. Cela nous amènera à la notion d’ontologie au sens de l’ingénierie des connaissances. La dernière section sera dédiée aux rapports qu’entretiennent la définition formelle du concept et la définition en langue naturelle du terme. Nous verrons en particulier qu’il est possible, si la théorie du concept est choisie de façon adéquate, de générer automatiquement des patrons de définition en langue naturelle à partir de la définition formelle. Il restera à l’expert à les éditer pour en améliorer la formulation., This article deals with the contribution of formal definition of concepts to the definition of terms in natural language in the context of the ontological turn of terminology. Ontology in the sense of knowledge engineering constitutes one of the most promising perspectives for conceptual terminology, for which a term is a verbal designation of a concept, and a concept a unit of knowledge. The contribution of ontology is not limited to the operationalization of terminology for IT applications. By making concepts explicit, i.e., by defining them in a formal language, ontology strongly impacts terminology, both in its principles and methods. Specifying concepts in a formal language allows guaranteeing “good” properties, such as the objectivity of definitions whose interpretation is governed by theory alone. The definition of terms in a natural language can then be considered as a translation of the formal definition of a concept. How these two types of definition are linked to each other remains to be clarified, and in particular whether it is possible to generate patterns of term definition based on formal concept definition. This will depend on the formal language which will be used, and on the underlying concept theory.",

        "abstract": "Avant-propos La Terminologie est une discipline scientifique qui puise à de nombreux domaines dont la linguistique, la théorie de la connaissance et la logique. Pour que cette diversité soit une richesse, il faut lui offrir un cadre approprié au sein duquel elle puisse s’exprimer et s’épanouir : c’est une des raisons d’être des Conférences TOTh. Dans ce contexte, la formation et la transmission des connaissances jouent un rôle essentiel. La Formation TOTh, programmée sur un jour et demi précédant la conférence, se déroule depuis 2011 sur deux années consécutives dédiées pour l’une à la dimension linguistique et pour l’autre à la dimension conceptuelle de la terminologie, deux dimensions étroitement liées. La Disputatio, introduite en 2011, renoue avec une forme d’enseignement et de recherche héritée de la scolastique. Elle vise, à travers une lecture commentée effectuée par un membre du comité scientifique, à donner accès à des auteurs et à des textes jugés fondateurs pour notre domaine : l’Isagogè de Porphyre en 2011, terminologie et variation chez Wüster en 2012 et l’apport de Saussure à la Terminologie cette année. Notre collègue François Rastier, directeur de recherche CNRS, a ouvert la Conférence TOTh 2013 par un exposé sur « Ontologie et référence » qui a donné lieu, on s’en doutait, à de nombreux échanges. On lira avec intérêt son article qui ne peut, en tant que terminologues, que nous interpeller. Les différentes communications ont permis d’aborder en profondeur – chaque intervention dure 45 minutes – de nombreux sujets tant théoriques que pratiques rappelant qu’il ne peut y avoir de Terminologie sans langue ni savoir de spécialité. Je vous invite à les découvrir à travers ces actes. Avant de vous souhaiter bonne lecture, j’aimerais terminer en remerciant tous les participants pour la richesse des débats et des moments partagés.

        "abstract": "Most definitions of ontology, viewed as a \"specification of a conceptualization\", agree on the fact that if an ontology can take different forms, it necessarily includes a vocabulary of terms and some specification of their meaning in relation to the domain's conceptualization. And as domain knowledge is mainly conveyed through scientific and technical texts, we can hope to extract some useful information from them for building ontology. But is it as simple as this? In this article we shall see that the lexical structure, i.e. the network of words linked by linguistic relationships, does not necessarily match the domain conceptualization. We have to bear in mind that writing documents is the concern of textual linguistics, of which one of the principles is the incompleteness of text, whereas building ontology - viewed as task-independent knowledge - is concerned with conceptualization based on formal and not natural languages. Nevertheless, the famous Sapir and Whorf hypothesis, concerning the interdependence of thought and language, is also applicable to formal languages. This means that the way an ontology is built and a concept is defined depends directly on the formal language which is used; and the results will not be the same. The introduction of the notion of ontoterminology allows to take into account epistemological principles for formal ontology building.",

L'aide à la traduction, les moteurs de recherche sémantique (multilingue), la gestion des connaissances, les bibliothèques numériques spécialisées, etc. sont autant d'applications qui requièrent une opérationnalisation des terminologies, c'est-à-dire une représentation computationnelle (informatique) de leur système notionnel. Dans ce cadre, les ontologies issues de l'ingénierie des connaissances constituent aujourd'hui une des voies les plus prometteuses pour la terminologie. Définie comme « une conceptualisation d'un domaine, c'est-à-dire une définition formelle (dans un langage compréhensible par un ordinateur) des concepts et de leurs relations décrivant une réalité partagée par une communauté de pratique », l'ontologie vise un objectif similaire à celui de la terminologie dans son approche normative de la communication et de l'échange d'information. Tout comme la terminologie, l'ontologie repose sur une théorie du concept qui la fonde. Cependant, une ontologie n'est pas une terminologie dont les termes seraient des dénominations de concept. Elle s'en distingue par son approche formelle du concept. Réciproquement, une terminologie n'est pas une ontologie dans la mesure où elle intègre une dimension linguistique étrangère à l'ontologie.",

Si le langage naturel n'est pas un mode d'expression adapté à la description d'ontologies, nous verrons également que les langages formels posent un certain nombre de problèmes qui leur sont propres.

The need for a computational representation of terminology for IT applications raises new challenges for terminology. Ontology appears to be one of the most suitable solutions for such an issue. But an ontology is not a terminology as well as a terminology is not an ontology. Terminology, especially for technical domains, relies on two different semiotic systems: the linguistic one, which is directly linked to the \" Language for Special Purposes \" and the conceptual system that describes the domain knowledge. These two systems must be both separated and linked. The new paradigm of ontoterminology, i.e. a terminology whose conceptual system is a formal ontology, emphasizes the difference between the linguistic and conceptual dimensions of terminology while unifying them. A double semantic triangle is introduced in order to link terms (signifiers) to concept names on a first hand and meanings (signified) to concepts on the other hand. Such an approach allows two kinds of definition to be introduced. The definition of terms written in natural language is considered as a linguistic explanation while the definition of concepts written in a formal language is viewed as a formal specification that allows operationalization of terminology.",

Within this scope, ontologies, in the sense of knowledge engineering (i.e. a formal specification of the conceptualization of a subject field), pave the way towards modelling the notional system. By the same token, however, putting ontology at the heart of and making it the starting point of terminological work also means rethinking terminology’s very principles and methods, thus reminding us of the fact that knowledge of the subject field must also be taken into account. Terminology is more than just specialized lexicography, in the same way a concept, by its extra linguistic nature, cannot be reduced to the terms speaking of it. By recognizing terminology’s double conceptual and linguistic dimension – terminology is both a science of objects and a science of words – ontology yields a distinction between the definition of a term written in natural language (i.e. a linguistic explanation of a term) and the definition of a concept written in a formal language (i.e. a formal specification of a concept, its ontological definition). It is the only one to be standardized vis-à-vis the knowledge of the subject field and thus upholds linguistic diversity.",

        "abstract": "Au delà de la dimension matérielle (support, format d’encodage, système de lecture), notre patrimoine numérique est préservé dans la mesure où nous sommes capables d’y accéder. Dans le monde informationnel qui est aujourd’hui le nôtre, exister, c’est être accessible, visible. Comment représenter et décrire dans un format lisible, mais aussi organiser et classer une information de telle sorte qu’elle demeure accessible ? Comment ensuite la retrouver ? Mais aussi comment et quoi chercher ? Des questions d’autant plus prégnantes que les données, à travers le réseau internet et au-delà de la barrière des langues et des cultures, s’ouvrent et se lient par de multiples relations en une toile encore plus inextricable (données ouvertes et liées). Face à ces interrogations, les « connaissances » du domaine, qu’elles soient linguistiques, à travers les termes employés pour décrire le patrimoine, ou conceptuelles, à travers les idées que nous nous en faisons, apparaissent comme une panacée. Parfois qualifiées de « métadonnées » ou de « sémantiques », on espère, grâce à ces connaissances, organiser et structurer nos mémoires, identifier les termes qui en parlent le mieux, et ainsi les préserver puisqu’on saura comment y accéder. La démarche relève des Sciences de l’information – des thésaurus pour être plus précis – de la Terminologie, de la Linguistique dans une certaine mesure, et surtout de la Modélisation des connaissances. Autant de disciplines fortement impactées par les dernières avancées du numérique. Le web est devenu sémantique, les bases de connaissances se font ontologies, une notion qui envahit également la Terminologie et les thésaurus – les normes internationales ISO (International Organization for Standardization), censées régimenter tout cela, qu’elles portent sur la Terminologie (TC 37) ou la Gestion de l’information (TC 46), n’y échappent pas. Nous verrons, dans le cadre de cette contribution, les notions de Terminologie, d’Ontologie et de Thesaurus étudiées sous l’angle du terme et du concept. Nous verrons ainsi ce que ces approches ont de commun qui justifie qu’on puisse ici les convoquer, mais aussi en quoi elles diffèrent. En effet, si une terminologie, tout comme une ontologie, peuvent être mobilisées à des fins de gestion de l’information, elles ne se confondent pas et ne sont pas davantage des thésaurus ; et réciproquement. Par contre, les associer en un nouveau paradigme qui reste à préciser ouvre des perspectives des plus intéressantes, comme le laisse à penser le thème « thésaurus et ontologies » de la conférence. Cela nous amènera au dernier chapitre consacré à la notion d’ontoterminologie, terminologie dont le système notionnel est une ontologie formelle. Nous verrons comment cette démarche permet la gestion de l’information prenant en compte le multilinguisme et le multiculturalisme. Elle offre également, nous l’illustrerons à travers un premier exemple dédié à la gestion de contenus, de nouveaux paradigmes de navigation interactive et de recherche sémantique. Une application aux thésaurus multilingues réalisée dans le cadre d’un projet européen dédié à la gestion de biens culturels (Projet FP7 AthenaPlus) clôturera l’article., Beyond the material dimension (physical support, encoding format, reading system), digital memories are preserved, if they are accessible. As a matter of fact, in today's information world, to exist is to be visible and accessible. How to represent information and render it in a readable format, how to organize and classify it, so that it is accessible? But also how and what to look for? How then to find it? These issues are all the more important that data are more and more open and interlinked through multiple relationships in an inextricable web (open and linked data). Facing these issues, the \"knowledge\" of the domain, whether linguistic, through the terms used to describe digital memories, or conceptual, through the ideas that we have of them, appears as a panacea. Domain knowledge, sometimes also called \"metadata\" or \"semantic\", aims to organize and structure our memories, identify the most suitable terms for describing them, and thus preserve digital heritage, since we will then know how to access it. This approach falls under four main disciplines: Information Sciences - Thesaurus to be more precise -, Terminology, since term and concept are involved, Linguistics to some extent, and, most importantly, Knowledge representation; four disciplines also heavily impacted by the latest advances in digital. The web has become semantic, and knowledge bases are rethought as ontologies. The latter notion has also permeated Terminology and Thesaurus, as well as the ISO international standards on Terminology (TC 37) and Information and documentation (TC 46). This talk will present the notions of Terminology, Ontology and Thesaurus from the perspective of term and concept, what these approaches have in common, but also how they differ. Indeed, if a terminology or an ontology can be used for information management, that does not mean it can be considered as a thesaurus, nor should it be taken for one. However, combining terminologies, thesauri, and ontologies into a new paradigm, which remains to be defined, opens up new perspectives, as suggested by one of the topics of this conference (“thesauri and ontologies”). The final part of the talk will be dedicated to the notion of ontoterminology, i.e. a terminology whose concept system is a formal ontology. Such an approach allows an information management system to take multilingualism and multiculturalism into account. It also offers new paradigms of interactive navigation and semantic search. This will be illustrated by means of an example of an ontology-oriented CMS (Content Management System). The paper will close with the presentation of a software environment for multilingual ontology-oriented thesauri building carried out under the umbrella of a European project in Cultural Heritage (FP7 AthenaPlus).",

For example, the ISO standards offer more than forty definitions of ontology ranging from a conceptual system to a structured vocabulary. However, while we can agree on a definition of ontology, ontologies in the same domain may differ and need to be harmonized. There are different approaches, methods and techniques for ontology terminology harmonization (including ontology terminology alignment) ranging from a linguistic one focusing on terms to a conceptual one focusing on concepts and their relationships. These issues will be studied from the point of view of ISO on Terminology where a term is a verbal designation of a concept, and a concept is a unique combination of characteristics This talk will be illustrated with the ISO 860 Standard on “Harmonization of concepts and terms”.",

L’intérêt qu’a suscité cette journée nous amènera certainement à réitérer l’opération les années suivantes. Le succès de la conférence d’ouverture de notre collègue Frédéric Nef, portant sur l’ontologie prise dans sa dimension philosophique, a montré, s’il en était encore besoin, la richesse d’une approche pluridisciplinaire. Animées par différents présidents, les sessions ont alterné présentations théoriques et démonstrations de systèmes, offrant ainsi l’opportunité à plusieurs industriels de nous parler de leurs projets. L’éventail des sujets abordés, à travers les quatorze présentations retenues (incluant la conférence d’ouverture) réparties sur deux jours, illustre la richesse mais aussi la vitalité de notre communauté : aide à la traduction, thésaurus multilingue, phraséologie, entité nommé, recherche d’information, etc. L’ « actualité » n’était pas oubliée à travers une ontologie des risques financiers. Enfin, les Conférences TOTh sont devenues internationales à partir de cette année avec le français et l’anglais comme langues officielles. Le comité de programme s’est ouvert à de nouveaux membres portant à dix le nombre de pays représentés et à plus de 40% le nombre de personnalités étrangères.

Cet article s'intéresse à la définition des termes en Terminologie dite conceptuelle pour laquelle un terme est une désignation verbale d'un concept considéré comme une connaissance extralinguistique. Termes et concepts ne relevant pas des mêmes dimensions, un concept ne peut être défini en langue naturelle. En définissant le concept dans un langage formel, la définition du terme apparaît comme une traduction en langue naturelle de la définition du concept. Le choix du langage formel, et donc de la théorie du concept sousjacente, n'est pas sans conséquence sur ce processus de traduction et son automatisation. Nous verrons que la génération automatique de patrons de définition en langue naturelle à partir des définitions formelles des concepts sera possible si la théorie du concept choisie le permet. Nous illustrerons nos propos à l'aide de deux environnements de construction de systèmes conceptuels (ontologies).",

Pour que cette diversité soit une richesse, il faut lui offrir un cadre approprié au sein duquel elle puisse s’exprimer et s’épanouir : c’est une des raisons d’être des Conférences TOTh. Dans ce contexte, la formation et la transmission des connaissances jouent un rôle essentiel. La Formation TOTh, programmée sur un jour et demi précédant la conférence, se déroule depuis 2011 sur deux années consécutives dédiées pour l’une à la dimension linguistique et pour l’autre à la dimension conceptuelle de la terminologie, deux dimensions intimement liées. La Disputatio, introduite à partir de cette année, renoue avec une forme d’enseignement et de recherche héritée de la scolastique. Elle vise, à travers une lecture commentée effectuée par un membre du comité scientifique, à donner accès à des textes jugés fondateurs de notre domaine, trop souvent oubliés voire ignorés. La cinquième édition des Conférences TOTh a également été l’occasion de mettre en place un Prix « Jeune chercheur ». Décerné par le comité scientifique lors de la conférence, il récompense le travail soumis à TOTh d’un de nos jeunes collègues. Notre collègue Michele Prandi, professeur à l’Università degli Studi di Genova, a ouvert la Conférence TOTh 2011 par un exposé passionnant sur : « Signes, signifiés, concepts : pour un tournant philosophique en linguistique ». Le ton était donné. Ont suivi douze communications (hors conférence d’ouverture et disputatio) réparties sur deux jours en six sessions animées par différents présidents. Elles ont permis d’aborder en profondeur – chaque intervention dure au minimum 45 minutes – de nombreux sujets tant théoriques que pratiques rappelant qu’il ne peut y avoir de terminologie sans langue de spécialité ni savoir spécialisé. Les douze communications, équitablement réparties sur les deux langues officielles de la conférence et provenant de sept pays différents, confirment l’audience internationale acquise aujourd’hui par TOTh. Avant de vous souhaiter bonne lecture de ces actes, j’aimerais terminer en remerciant tous les participants de TOTh 2011 pour la richesse des débats et des moments partagés.

Deux termes qui pourraient s’opposer à plus d’un titre – le premier portant sur une pratique, le deuxième relevant de la métaphysique – et qui sont néanmoins de plus en plus associés.

Cet article a pour objet de présenter et de situer les principales approches relevant de la terminologie et de l’ontologie et d’indiquer en quoi elles peuvent être liées. Nous verrons en particulier quels peuvent être les apports de l’ontologie, tant d’un point de vue méthodologique que pratique, pour la modélisation et la représentation de la signification des termes. Pour cela nous serons amené à distinguer ce qui relève de l’usage, de l’intellection et de la représentation. Activité pratique répondant à un besoin de clarification, la terminologie est également une science. Elle constitue une discipline à part entière qui, tout en puisant à la linguistique et à l’épistémologie, s’en distingue. Plusieurs problèmes ne seront pas abordés dans le cadre de cet article d’introduction générale, aussi importants soient-ils, et même si l’ontologie (ou les ontologies) apporte des solutions novatrices.

Si vouloir appliquer l’approche normative de la science à la langue, même technique, est une erreur – la langue ne se normalise pas – réduire la connaissance à ce qu’on peut en dire l’est tout autant – il ne faut pas confondre les discours sur la connaissance avec la connaissance elle-même. Il nous faut concilier les dimensions linguistique et conceptuelle qui composent toute terminologie. Pour cela, nous devons accepter qu’un terme, même s’il n’est pas n’importe quel mot, s’emploie en discours comme un mot et donne lieu à construction d’un signifié. Mais c’est aussi accepter de ne pas confondre le terme avec un « nom » de concept – « identifiant » serait plus approprié – car ils ne relèvent pas du même système sémiotique ; accepter de distinguer la définition du terme, explication linguistique, de la définition du concept, spécification formelle et constructive .",

Il suffit d’être à l’écoute des besoins des industriels et des préoccupations des chercheurs, de constater les mutations d’une société numérique où la connaissance tient une place prépondérante. L’intérêt porté aux conférences TOTh l’illustre bien. Cela nous a amenés, dès la seconde édition de TOTh, à poser certains fondements pour asseoir et rythmer notre communauté qui rassemble diverses disciplines, de la linguistique à l’ingénierie des connaissances. C’est avant tout une unité de lieu. Afin que chacun puisse s’approprier le lieu de nos rencontres, les conférences TOTh se déroulent à Annecy. Au-delà de la beauté de la ville, on s’imagine prolonger les débats le long de ses rues médiévales et canaux devenus familiers. C’est aussi une unité de temps. Les conférences se déroulent, chaque année, le premier jeudi et le premier vendredi du mois de juin. Vous pouvez d’ores et déjà l’inscrire sur vos tablettes. C’est enfin, et peut-être surtout, le respect de la différence. Le comité de programme de TOTh 2008 s’est considérablement enrichi afin de traduire le nécessaire caractère pluridisciplinaire de la terminologie. Les conférences TOTh se veulent un lieu d’échange où chacun, dans sa diversité, peut s’exprimer et être respecté, un lieu de partage où les résultats de nos travaux sont accessibles à tous.

Such a conceptualization is corpus-dependent and does not offer the main properties we expect from ontology, e.g. reusability and soundness. Furthermore, ontology extracted from text in general does not match ontology defined by expert using a formal language. Such a result is not surprising since ontology is an extra-linguistic conceptualization whereas knowledge extracted from text is the concern of textual linguistics. Incompleteness of text and using rhetorical figures, like synecdoche, deeply modify the perception of the conceptualization we may have. It means that ontological knowledge, which is necessary for text understanding, is not in general embedded into documents. The article will end on some remarks about formal languages. If they allow to define \" a specification of a conceptualization \" they nevertheless raise their own issues mainly due to their epistemological neutrality. Ontology design remains an epistemological issue.",

        "abstract": "Avant propos Dès la troisième édition, les conférences TOTh ont trouvé une structuration qui traduit bien à la fois le caractère scientifique et pluridisciplinaire de la terminologie et l’intérêt de notre communauté pour d’autres domaines partageant des préoccupations communes. Ainsi, la conférence d’ouverture a été donnée par une personnalité invitée issue d’une discipline différente de la nôtre – ici la phylogénèse – mais pour laquelle le langage et la pensée jouent également un rôle primordial. Les contributions se sont réparties naturellement, et par le jeu des évaluations de façon équitable, en trois groupes ayant donné lieu à trois sessions. Le premier groupe a rassemblé les articles portant principalement sur la dimension linguistique de la terminologie. Ont été abordés l’extraction terminologique à partir de dictionnaire, la place accordée aux corpus dans la construction de terminologies, l’acquisition de connaissances à partir de textes et l’apport des ressources linguistiques issues du web. La deuxième session s’est donc logiquement intéressée à la dimension conceptuelle de la terminologie. Les notions de concept, de relation, d’ontologie ont été au cœur des présentations portant sur les cartes conceptuelles pour les bibliothèques numériques, les relations dynamiques et les graphes conceptuels, l’alignement d’ontologies et l’accès multilingue aux ontologies. Enfin, la troisième session a été consacrée à la présentation de plusieurs applications terminologiques pour des secteurs aussi différents que l’ingénierie nucléaire, l’informatique, le domaine bancaire ou l’agriculture biologique. Il est à souligner que ces applications ont permis d’aborder différents points théoriques tels que la variation terminologique, la diachronie ou la structure des dictionnaires. La richesse des débats qui ont animé ces deux jours de conférence – chaque présentation, questions comprises, s’est vue allouer plus de quarante cinq minutes de temps de parole – a été certainement une des plus belles récompenses pour les participants de TOTh 2009.

Ce n'est pas sans difficulté que les industriels conçoivent ces logiciels dont un des principaux handicaps est que les simulations sont très coûteuses en temps. L'objectif principal de ce travail est de rechercher et développer des algorithmes de calcul plus performants. Dans un premier temps, on décrit précisément le modèle du transport des photons dans ce contexte, composé de l'équation de Boltzmann accompagné de conditions de bord, et qui, dans le cas de milieux homogènes par morceaux, se ramène à l'équation de radiosité. Ensuite, on présente les outils géométriques utilisés dans le modeleur hybride CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) et BRep (Boundary Representation) ainsi que les algorithmes de base nécessaires à la recherche d'intersections entre des demi-droites et des objets géométriques. Puis, un tour d'horizon des méthodes d'accélération des calculs en radiométrie par localisation spatiale est présenté. En tenant compte des contraintes industrielles, une telle méthode d'accélération est alors adaptée au contexte puis développée dans un environnement logiciel existant. Des expérimentations numériques montrent l'efficacité des nouvelles bibliothèques. Enfin, une étude théorique des complexités en temps et en mémoire liées aux méthodes de localisation spatiale, faisant intervenir les sommes de Minkowski d'ensembles géométriques, débouche sur une stratégie consistant à minimiser la complexité en temps pour choisir les paramètres de localisation., Physic of the light and geometrical tools for Computer Aided Geometric Design are the basis of light phenomenon simulation software for optical systems development. It is difficult for industrials to design and produce those software with a major handicap being the time needed for the simulations. The aim of this work is to search and to develop calculus algorithms with higher performances. Firstly, we describe precisely the photon transport model in our context. We use Boltzmann equation with boundary conditions which is the radiosity equation in case of homogeneous media by piece. Secondly, we introduce geometrical tools used in CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) and BRep (Boundary Representation) hybrid modeller. Basic algorithms looking for intersections between half-lines and geometrical objects are described. Then, we present a survey of acceleration methods in radiometric computation by spatial localization. Taking into account the constraints relevant to the industry, such an acceleration method is adapted to our context and then developed in an existing software environment. Numerical tests show the efficiency of the new libraries. Finally, we study the time and memory complexities of spatial localization methods. This theoretical study uses Minkowski's sums of geometrical sets. An important result is a strategical method minimizing time complexity to choose the localization parameters.",

Dans ce cadre, et dans le contexte du partage et de l’interopérabilité des données sur le Web, les ontologies au sens de l’Ingénierie des Connaissances (IC )constituent une des avancées les plus intéressantes. Mais les principes sous-jacents à la conceptualisation d’un domaine tels que l’entendent l’IC et les HN ne sont pas nécessairement les mêmes. À cela s’ajoute un problème de Terminologie en tant que discipline souvent sous-estimée aussi bien par les uns que par les autres. Cet article s’intéresse àla façon de procéder des experts dans leur “définition des choses” et dans la manière de les nommer. Cela nous a conduits à définir une méthode outillée de construction de terminologies dont le système conceptuel est une ontologie formelle, dans le respect des normes ISO et des standards du W3C. Cette méthode est illustrée à l’aide du premier dictionnaire ontoterminologique des vêtements de la Grèce antique., Classifying objects and choosing the right terms and definitions for them, all the while taking domain knowledge into account, are constant concerns in Digital Humanities (DH). In this regard, as well as in that of data interoperability and sharing on the Web, ontologies, in the sense of Knowledge Engineering (KE), constitute one of the most interesting developments. When conceptualizing a domain, the underlying principles in AI do not necessarily dovetail with those in DH. Adding to that, Terminology, as a discipline, has not really received due attention by AI and DH specialists as yet. This article is interested in the way experts work towards coming up with “definitions of things” and with naming things. The result of this reflection is a tool-assisted method for building terminologies whose conceptual system is a formal ontology, compliant with the ISO and W3C standards. The approach is illustrated by means of presenting the first ontoterminology dictionary of garments of ancient Greece., La clasificación de los objetos, la elección de los términos y su definición con respecto al conocimiento del ámbito son preocupaciones constantes en las Humanidades Digitales (HD).

The Cultural Biography of a Garment in Hellenistic Egypt, grant 657898). Le flou terminologique qui règne autour des études consacrées aux vêtements de cette époque, dont les sources sont souvent lacunaires (Delaporte 1981, 7), entrave fortement la communication et le partage de connaissances entre experts. Identifier clairement ce que désignent les termes dans ce qu’ils ont de précis, mais aussi de vague, et également bien nommer les choses ont été au cœur de notre projet, qui a nécessité une représentation explicite des connaissances définissant les différents types de vêtements. À cette préoccupation d’ordre terminologique s’est ajouté le besoin de pouvoir identifier un vêtement donné en fonction de ses caractéristiques, c’est-à-dire de pouvoir identifier (classifier) le ou les types de vêtements auxquels il appartient. Il convient de noter qu’aujourd’hui il n’existe pas de système de classification (semi-)automatisé des vêtements en tant qu’artéfacts culturels des cultures passées qui soit unanimement reconnu. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous nous sommes intéressés à la notion d’ontologie issue de l’ingénierie des connaissances et du Web sémantique, et par conséquent à celle d’ontoterminologie, terminologie dont le système conceptuel est une ontologie formelle. Il a fallu alors définir une méthodologie de construction de l’ontoterminologie, faisant intervenir successivement les dimensions linguistique et conceptuelle. Celle-ci repose sur un ensemble de caractéristiques essentielles, connaissances « primitives » partagées par les experts, à partir desquelles se construit l’ontologie du domaine. Le résultat est une terminologie multilingue (anglais, français, grec) dont la signification des termes repose sur une ontologie du domaine des vêtements de la Grèce antique, posée ici comme partagée et consensuelle, et qui peut donner lieu à de nombreuses applications informatiques : dictionnaires terminologiques multilingues, moteurs de recherche sémantiques multilingues, classification automatique, gestion documentaire, gestion des connaissances, etc. Ce projet a mis en évidence l’importance, voire la nécessité, de disposer d’une méthode outillée reposant sur une approche pluridisciplinaire, conciliant les démarches « émique » et « étique », et puisant à la linguistique, la terminologie et la modélisation des connaissances issue de l’intelligence artificielle ; une méthode qui permet la collaboration des différents intervenants et dont les résultats peuvent être partagés grâce à l’utilisation de formats d’échange respectant les standards en vigueur, dont ceux de l’ISO et du W3C. Cet article s’attachera plus particulièrement à présenter la méthode et l’outil employés dans le cadre de ce projet en ce qu’ils ont de généralisable pour des projets similaires relevant des humanités numériques, ainsi que certains des résultats obtenus., This article presents the results of a collaboration between a classical philologist and a terminologist initiated during an EU-funded research project on ancient Greek clothing (Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions Project Chlamys. The Cultural Biography of a Garment in Hellenistic Egypt, grant 657898). The terminological ambiguity prevailing in the studies on garments of this period, whose sources are often incomplete (Delaporte 1981, 7), severely hinders the communication and knowledge sharing among experts. Clearly identifying what the terms designate, in what is specific, but also vague, as well as the naming of garments was at the heart of our research, which demanded the explicit representation of the knowledge that defines the different types of clothing. Added to this terminological concern is the need to enable the identification of a given garment according to its characteristics, i.e. to be able to identify (classify) the type or types of clothing to which it belongs. It should be noted that today there is no universally recognised (semi-)automated classification of garments as cultural artefacts of past cultures. This is why we are interested in the notion of ontology resulting from knowledge engineering and the semantic Web, and consequently in ontoterminology, a terminology whose conceptual system is a formal ontology. It was then necessary to define a methodology for the construction of such an ontoterminology, alternating the linguistic and conceptual dimensions. Ontoterminology defines concepts based on a set of essential characteristics, “knowledge primitives” shared by the experts, from which the ontology of the domain is built. The result is a multilingual terminology whose meaning is based on an ontology of the clothing domain of ancient Greece, which is seen here as shared and consensual, and which can give rise to many computer applications: multilingual terminology dictionaries, multilingual semantic search engines, automatic classification, document management, knowledge management, etc. This project highlighted the importance, even the necessity, of having a tool-assisted method based on a multidisciplinary approach, reconciling “emic” and “etic” approaches, and drawing on linguistics, terminology and knowledge modelling, a field of artificial intelligence. It also highlighted the importance of adopting a method that allows the collaboration of distributed end users, and whose results can be shared through the use of exchange formats complying with the standards in force, including those of the ISO and of the W3C. This article will focus on presenting the method and tool used in this project as they have generalisable features for similar projects in digital humanities, as well as some of the results obtained.",

In answering this we used a highly interdisciplinary approach that brings together ontology engineering and linguistics and applies them to classics, dress history, material culture and cultural heritage studies. In this paper we describe the building of the first multilingual ontoterminology of the domain of ancient Greek garments, i.e. a terminology whose conceptual model is a formal ontology. For the modelling of the domain knowledge of ancient Greek dress we used Tedi (ontoTerminology editor), a new software environment , compliant with semantic web standards, specifically catering to the needs of terminologists and cultural heritage specialists researching and/or making use of terminologies of their respective fields. In what follows we present the basic steps towards the definition of the concepts of the domain in a formal language (i.e. not in natural language) by means of specific axes of analysis. We aim for very finely structured knowledge which can eventually support two types of queries: by means of words, but also by means of ideas (concepts). The outcome is a multilingual set of consistently 1 defined terms of the domain of ancient Greek dress. Our approach evidences the conceptual richness and complexity of this domain, while demonstrating the importance of having at the expert's disposal specialized software for the representation of complex domain knowledge and terminology. 1 i.e. in accordance with domain knowledge., Cet article décrit la construction de la première ontoterminologie multilingue du domaine des vêtements de la Grèce antique, c’est-à-dire une terminologie dont le modèle conceptuel est une ontologie formelle. Notre recherche a pour objectif l’exploitation de sources textuelles, visuelles et matérielles afin de dé-finir une ontoterminologie qui élargira et approfondira notre compréhension tant conceptuelle que terminologique du domaine des vêtements. Pour y ré-pondre, nous avons suivi une démarche interdisciplinaire associant l’ingénierie ontologique à la linguistique pour les appliquer aux Classiques, à l’histoire de l'habillement, à l’histoire sociale et culturelle et aux études du patrimoine cultu-rel. La modélisation des connaissances du domaine s’est faite à l’aide de l’environnement Tedi (onTerminology editor), un nouvel environnement logi-ciel répondant spécifiquement aux besoins des terminologues et des spécialistes du patrimoine culturel. Cet article présente les étapes suivies pour la construc-tion de l’ontologie du domaine et la définition des termes sur la base de caracté-ristiques essentielles structurées en axes d’analyse et posées comme extralin-guistiques : la définition des termes en langue naturelle s’appuie sur la défini-tion formelle des concepts qui en constitue également la justification. Le résul-tat est un ensemble multilingue de termes du domaine des vêtements de la Grèce antique définis de manière “cohérente” au sens où leur définition repose sur les propriétés de l’ontologie formelle. Associées à des connaissances fine-ment structurées, cette démarche autorise deux types de requêtes, non seule-ment au moyen de mots, mais aussi au moyen d’idées (concepts).

Human and machine readable terminological resources, which follow the ISO standards on terminology in defining concepts as unique combinations of essential characteristics [ISO 1087-1], need to become computable and Semantic Web compliant. This paper, first, describes the theoretical approach and the tool-assisted method which underlies the turning of these terminologies into Semantic web compliant ontologies. Next, this paper presents Tedi (ontoTerminology editor), the platform developed for building multilingual terminologies which share the same formal domain ontology. Tedi allows to export these terminologies into OWL/RDF ontologies, JSON, and in a number of other formats, including multilingual electronic dictionaries of terms in the form of static and dynamic html. Tedi is based on a theory of concept dedicated to Terminology, the discipline which defines semantics as the relation between terms (natural language units with meaning specialized to a domain of knowledge) and concepts (units of thought whose meaning is formally expressed as a set of essential characteristics). Tedi stores the linguistic and the conceptual dimensions in two distinct, yet related systems. This formal theory which supplies the semantic onto-terminological layer needed for deeper data interpretability by machines is less contrived and far more intuitive to use. It empowers domain experts to build their own semantic multilingual terminological dictionaries without having to be aware of logical formalisms like description logics. Semantic content management systems are direly needed in the domain of ancient cultural heritage. The remainder of the paper will illustrate this particular point with a use case from the domain of ancient Greek dress terminology presented from the point of view of the user (domain expert).",

        "abstract": "Différentes recherches ont montré que le processus émotionnel joue un rôle important dans la résolution de problèmes et la prise de décisions. La décision et les choix sont de plus en plus vus comme influencés par les émotions au même titre que le processus social. Dans la littérature, de nombreuses théories existent sur la définition des émotions. Aucune de ces théories ne proposent une terminologie claire, un cadre formel et une classification précise des émotions. L’objectif de cet article est d’étudier la faisabilité d’une définition ontologique et formelle d’une terminologie des émotions s’appuyant sur les principes terminologiques des normes ISO (ISO 1087 et ISO 704). Une telle approche, reposant sur la notion de caractéristique essentielle, permettrait une classification plus précise des émotions et une clarification des définitions. L’approche formelle a pour but d’aboutir à une représentation computationnelle des émotions à des fins de traitement de l’information comme par exemple la prise de décisions par des agents logiciels. Notre objectif est de \"make émotions computable ». A cette dimension purement conceptuelle s’ajoute une dimension linguistique dans la recherche des termes se rattachant aux émotions soit directement à travers leurs dénominations ou indirectement à travers des expressions s’y référant. La mise en œuvre se fera à l’aide de l’environnement de construction d’ontologies Protégé et de l’environnement de construction d’ontoterminologies TEDI.",

In answering this we used a highly interdisciplinary approach that brings together ontology engineering and linguistics and applies them to clas-sics, dress history, material culture and cultural heritage studies. In this paper we describe the building of the first multilingual ontoterminology of the do-main of ancient Greek garments, i.e. a terminology whose conceptual model is a formal ontology. For the modelling of the domain knowledge of ancient Greek dress we used Tedi (ontoTerminology editor), a new software environ-ment, compliant with semantic web standards, specifically catering to the needs of terminologists and cultural heritage specialists researching and/or making use of terminologies of their respective fields. In what follows we pre-sent the basic steps towards the definition of the concepts of the domain in a formal language (i.e. not in natural language) by means of specific axes of analysis. We aim for very finely structured knowledge which can eventually support two types of queries: by means of words, but also by means of ideas (concepts). The outcome is a multilingual set of consistently defined terms of the domain of ancient Greek dress. Our approach evidences the conceptual richness and complexity of this domain, while demonstrating the importance of having at the expert’s disposal specialized software for the representation of complex domain knowledge and terminology.",

Through the analysis of the corpus, we have found that some common verbs in Portuguese, such as “choose” and “separate” acquire a specialised value in the field under study. This was the starting point for the analysis of the terminological collocations where verbs are the core constituents. For the analysis of these verbal terminological collocations, we used natural language processing techniques, building simple and complex CQL structures with RegEx. The outcome of this analysis permits us to introduce a distinction between polylexical terms and terminological collocations. The terminological collocation is a reality of great relevance in specialised discourse, but unlike terms, it is not defined by conceptual criteria, but by morphological and syntactic criteria.",

This can be particularly relevant in subject fields such as Medicine, where concept-oriented and ontology-based approaches have become the cornerstone of the most recent (bio)medical terminological resources, and where non-verbal concept representations play a key role.

        "abstract": "The French nuclear industry deals with technologies which will soon be thirty years old. If such technologies are not renewed they must last for another ten years- or more if the decision is taken to keep them working. There is a risk of technological obsolescence- something which is allowed for in other national and international projects. There is also the question of constant commercial demand- something also considered elsewhere in establishing contracts. Another problem is now beginning to emerge; the continuity and transmission of knowledge and experience concerning these plants. Personnel in the energy sector are being renewed. Most current employees are due to retire in the course of this decade. How is knowledge (both of maintenance and planning) to be transmitted to the new generations ? This knowledge includes written information but also knowhow and implicit working assumptions; expertise, experience, self-learning… In the United States the EPRI produced a technical dossier [EPRI 1]. The problem of knowledge of old technologies is therefore recent, but almost universal. As far as EDF knows, nobody is considering this subject in its entirety. Instead, each technology puts the emphasis on operation (and thus safety) according to a fixed timetable (ten-year visits, end of use). In this perspective the initial knowledge can be lost. It can happen, for example, that the need for renewal can oblige the agency to carry out a costly or difficult retro-engineering project so as to recover the original knowledge and technology. If we look ahead, the policy of long term development (notably extending the life of plants) requires us to consider the life-span of the different skills and knowledge required by each environment. So it is necessary to take into account the entire life cycle of a nuclear installation. We are working on organizing all this knowledge and building an innovating solution for easy acquisition, access and sharing knowledge and experiences. First we are creating an ontologybased common language for all involved and defining some applications on Intranet. Ontology, understood as an agreed vocabulary of common terms and meanings shared by a group of people, is a means for representing craft concepts upon which knowledge can be organised and classified. We shall present one of the first applications based on the Logic Diagrams Designer's ontology whose main goals are to keep in memory the craft knowledge about relay circuits schemas and to allow accessing and retrieval information. This choice of ontology as a basis provides an easy and relevant navigation, indexing and search of documents...",

The first step is to define the terminology of a domain. This implies a long and difficult task for specialized domains. If it is still difficult to find consensus on the definition of natural language, experience in various communities of practice shows that this is not the same for formal conceptualization of a domain in which experts generally agree. Based on this fact, we introduced a new paradigm, that of ontoterminology. The main idea is to separate the linguistic dimension of the conceptual dimension of terminology. We present the results of this new paradigm applied to the domain of hydraulics.",

Although some data sources have been digitized, the vision of heritage institutions is not only to display objects and simple descriptions (drawn from metadata) but also to allow for understanding relationships between objects (created by semantically interrelated metadata). The key to achieving this goal is to utilize the technologies of the Semantic Web, whose core is Ontology. The focus of this paper is to describe the construction of the TAO CI (\"ceramics\" in Chinese) ontology of the domain of ceramic vases of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. The theoretical and methodological approach adopted to construct the TAO CI ontology is term-and-characteristic guided, i.e., it relies on a morphological analysis of the Chinese terms used in the domain, and respects the ISO principles on Terminology (ISO 1087 and 704), according to which concepts are defined by means of essential characteristics. The research presented in this article aims to publish the resulting structured data on the Semantic Web for the use of anybody interested, including museums hosting collections of these vessels, and to enrich existing methodologies on domain ontology building. To our knowledge, there are no comprehensive ontologies for Chinese ceramic vases. TAO CI ontology remedies this gap and provides a reference for ontology building in other domains of Chinese cultural heritage.",

By doing so, they provide a theoretical and methodological foundation underlying the creation of knowledge-based terminological products that can support the conception and development of different types of e‑dictionaries. Within that scope, and based on examples pertaining to two different subject fields, namely endometriosis and Islamic archaeology, this article aims to propose a framework for the creation of a terminological e-dictionary, defined as a reference resource in a specific domain that gathers, structures and describes linguistic data in a systematic way in one, two or more languages, in order to define concepts that are denoted by terms.",

        "abstract": "Today, collaboration and the exchange of information are increasing steadily and players need to agree on the meaning of words. The first task is therefore to define the domain‟s terminology. However, terminology building remains a demanding and time-consuming task, even in specialised domains where standards already exist. While reaching a consensus on the definition of terms written in natural language remains difficult, we have observed that in specialised technical domains, experts agree on the domain conceptualisation when it is defined in a formal language. Based on this observation, we have introduced a new paradigm for terminology called ontoterminology. The main idea is to separate the linguistic dimension from the conceptual dimension of terminology and establish relationships between them. The linguistic component consists of terms (both normalised and non-normalised specialised words) linked by linguistic relationships such as hyponymy and synonymy. The term definition, written in natural-language, is considered a linguistic explanation. The conceptual component is a formal ontology whose concepts are linked by conceptual relationships like the is-a (kind of) and part-of relations. The concept definition, written in a formal language, is viewed as logical specification. An ontoterminology enables us to link these two non-isomorphic networks in a global and coherent system.",
